DESCRIPTION
     The create-http command creates a set of HTTP parameters for
     a  protocol,  which  in  turn configures a network listener.
     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --protocol
         The name of the associated protocol, which in turn  con-
         figures a network listener.

     --defaultvs

         The ID attribute of the default virtual server  for  the
         associated protocol.

     --servername
         Tells the server what to put in the host name section of
         any  URLs  it sends to the client. This affects URLs the
         server automatically generates; it  doesn't  affect  the
         URLs  for  directories  and  files stored in the server.
         This name should be the alias name if your  server  uses

         an  alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that
         port will be used in URLs that the server sends  to  the
         client.

     --xpowered

         If set to true, adds the X-Powered-By:  Servlet/2.4  and
         X-Powered-By:   JSP/2.0   headers   to  the  appropriate
         responses. The Servlet 2.4 specification defines the  X-
         Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 header, which containers may add
         to servlet-generated responses. Similarly, the  JSP  2.0
         specification  defines the X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 header,
         which containers may add to responses that use JSP tech-
         nology.   The goal of these headers is to aid in gather-
         ing statistical data  about the use of Servlet  and  JSP
         technology. The default is true.

     --redirectport
         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created
         with the cluster profile or the enterprise profile. Port
         number for redirects. If the associated network listener
         is  supporting  non-SSL  requests,  and  a  request   is
         received   for   which  a  matching  security-constraint
         requires SSL  transport,  the  Application  Server  will
         automatically redirect the request to this port number.

     --enableauthpassthrough

         If set to true, indicates that  the  associated  network
         listener  receives traffic from an SSL-terminating proxy
         server. The default is false.

     --maxkeepalive
         The maximum number of HTTP requests that  can  be  pipe-
         lined  until the connection is closed by the server. Set
         this property to 1 to disable  HTTP/1.0  keep-alive,  as
         well  as HTTP/1.1 keep-alive and pipelining. The default
         is 250.

     --keepalivetimeout

         The maximum time in seconds for which a keep alive  con-
         nection  is  kept  open. A value of 0 or less means keep
         alive  connections  are  kept  open  indefinitely.   The
         default is 30.

     --enablecometsupport

         If set to true, enables Comet support for the associated
         network listener. The default is false.

     --compression
         Specifies use  of  HTTP/1.1  GZIP  compression  to  save
         server bandwidth. Allowed values are:

             o    off  -   Disables  compression.  This  is   the
                  default.

             o    on - Compresses data.

             o    force - Forces data compression in all cases.

             o    positive integer - Specifies the minimum amount
                  of   data   required   before   the  output  is
                  compressed.
         If the  content-length  is  not  known,  the  output  is
         compressed only if compression is set to on or force.

     --compressablemimetype

         A comma-separated list of  MIME  types  for  which  HTTP
         compression    is    used.    The   default   value   is
         text/html,text/xml,text/plain.

     --nocompressionuseragents
         A comma-separated list of regular  expressions  matching
         user-agents of HTTP clients for which compression should
         not be used. The default is an empty string, which  dis-
         ables regexp matching.

     --compressionminsize

         The minimum size of a file when compression is  applied.
         There is no default.

     --uriencoding
         The character  set  used  to  decode  the  request  URIs
         received  on  the associated network listener. Must be a
         valid IANA character set name. The default is UTF-8.

     --restricteduseragents

         A comma-separated list of regular  expressions  matching

asadmin Utility Subcommands                        create-http(1)

         user-agents  of  HTTP clients that should be restricted.
         The default is an empty string.

     --requesttimeout

         The time in seconds at which the request times out.  The
         default is 30.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-http command

     The following command creates an HTTP parameter set:

       asadmin> create-http --user admin1
       --passwordfile passwords.txt --host host1 --port 4848
       --protocol http-1 --defaultvs server --servername host1.sun.com
       Command create-http executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
