<a name="abtadmcons"></a><h3>Admin Console Overview</h3>
<p>The Admin Console is a browser-based tool that features an easy-to-navigate interface. The
Application Server consists of one or more domains. A domain is an administrative
boundary or context. Each domain has an administration server (also called the Domain
Administration Server or DAS) associated with it and consists of zero or more
standalone instances and/or clusters. Each cluster has one or more homogeneous server instances.
A server instance is a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that runs the
Application Server on a single physical machine. Server instances (whether standalone or clustered)
in a domain can run on different physical hosts.</p><p>The DAS provides a central point for managing a Application Server domain. In
a domain where there is a single Application Server instance, that server
functions as the DAS. The DAS hosts the Admin Console, which is a
web application accessible from any supported web browser with network access to the
administration server.</p>
