User Commands                           change-master-password(1)

NAME
     change-master-password - changes the master password

SYNOPSIS
     change-master-password [--domaindir domain_path | --agentdir
     node-agent_path] [--savemasterpassword=false] [domain_name |
     node_agent_name]

DESCRIPTION
     This local command is used to modify  the  master  password.
     change-master-password  is  interactive  in that the user is
     prompted for the old master password, as  well  as  the  new
     master  password.  This  command  will  not  work unless the
     server is stopped. In a distributed environment,  this  com-
     mand  must  run on each machine in the domain, with the node
     agent stopped.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir             This option specifies the  directory
                             used   for   this   operation.    By
                             default,    the     domaindir     is
                             $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH,  which  is  an
                             environment  variable   defined   in
                             asenv.bat/conf.  Both  the domaindir
                             and the agentdir options should  not
                             be  passed  together; use one or the
                             other.

     --agentdir              Like a DAS, each Node Agent  resides
                             in   a  top  level  directory  named
                             <agentdir>/<nodeagent_name>. If  the
                             agentdir   is  not  specified,  then
                             $AS_DEF_DOMAINS_PATH/../nodeagents
                             is  used. Both the domaindir and the
                             agentdir  options  should   not   be
                             passed  together;  use  one  or  the
                             other.

     --savemasterpassword    This option  indicates  whether  the
                             master password should be written to
                             the file system. This  is  necessary
                             so  that  start-domain can start the
                             server without having to prompt  the
                             user.  WARNING:  saving  the  master
                             password  on   disk   is   extremely
                             dangerous and should be avoided.

                             NOTE: if savemasterpassword  is  not

                             set, the master password file, if it
                             exists, will be deleted.

OPERANDS
     domain_name             This is the domain name whose  pass-
                             word  is  to be changed. If there is
                             only  a  single  domain,   this   is
                             optional.

     node_agent_name         This is the name of the  node  agent
                             whose password is to be changed.
