<ol><li><p><b>In the tree component, select the Application Server node.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Click the Monitor tab.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Click the Resources tab.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Select the resource to monitor from the View list.</b></p><p>The
page then displays monitoring data for the selected resource. For a description
of properties that can be monitored, see <A HREF="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-3671" target="_blank">Chapter 17, "Monitoring Components and Services," in <i>Sun Java System Application Server Enterprise Edition 9.1 Administration Guide</i></A>.</p>
<p>If the resource you wish to monitor does not appear, click Configure
Monitoring.</p>
<p>If no monitoring data is displayed for resources,
it is most likely that the resource does not exist or is not exercised. Resources
monitoring data is available only when the resources exist, monitoring is
enabled for the resource at a level of HIGH, and the resource is being exercised.
For example, if you have created a JDBC connector service, but applications
that use that connector service have not yet requested a connector from the
service, that service has not yet been created, therefore, no service exists
and no monitoring data is available. Once the JDBC application is executed
and requests a connector from a service, the service is registered in the
monitoring registry and monitoring data appears.</p>
