DESCRIPTION
     The list-jbi-service-assemblies command  lists  the  service
     assemblies  deployed into the JBI environment. If no filters
     are specified, the command will list all the  deployed  ser-
     vice assemblies.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --lifecyclestate        Helps list  the  service  assemblies
                             based  on  its  current  state.  For
                             example, if you want  to  list  only
                             those  service  assemblies  that are
                             started, you can specify the  option
                             -lifecyclestate  with  the  value as
                             started.  By  default,  all  service
                             assemblies are listed, regardless of
                             their states. Valid values for  this
                             option are:

                               o  shutdown, which lists  all  the
                                  service   assemblies  that  are
                                  currently shut down.

                               o  started, which  lists  all  the
                                  service  assemblies that are in
                                  the  'started'  state  on   the
                                  specified target.

                               o  stopped, which  lists  all  the
                                  service   assemblies   on   the
                                  specified target that  are  not
                                  running.

     --target                Specifies the target for  which  you
                             want  to list the JBI service assem-
                             blies. Specify this option  only  if
                             the  service assemblies are deployed
                             in a multiserver environment with  a
                             Domain  Administration Server (DAS).
                             If the service  assemblies  are  not
                             deployed  in  a multiserver environ-
                             ment with  a  DAS,  this  option  is
                             ignored. Valid values are:

                               o  server, which lists the service
                                  assemblies  on the embedded DAS
                                  instance. This is  the  default
                                  value.

                               o  domain, which lists the service
                                  assemblies  for the administra-
                                  tive  domain  itself.   Specify
                                  domain  only  if  you are using
                                  the cluster profile.

                               o  cluster_name, which  lists  the
                                  service  assemblies  for  every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name, which lists  the
                                  service   assemblies   for  the
                                  named    unclustered     server
                                  instance.

     --componentname         Specifies the name of the  component
                             for  which  you want to list the JBI
                             service assemblies.
