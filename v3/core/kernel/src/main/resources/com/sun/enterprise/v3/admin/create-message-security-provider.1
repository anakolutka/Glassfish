NAME
     create-message-security-provider  -  enables  administrators
     to  create  the  message-security-config and provider-config
     sub-elements for the security service in domain.xml

DESCRIPTION
     The  create-message-security-provider  command  enables  the
     administrator  to  create  the  message-security-config  and
     provider-config sub-elements for  the  security  service  in
     domain.xml  (the  file that specifies parameters and proper-
     ties of a domain to the Enterprise  ServerTM).  The  options
     specified  in  the list below apply to attributes within the
     message-security-config and provider-config sub-elements  of
     the domain.xml file.

     If the message-layer (message-security-config) element  does
     not exist, this command creates it, and then provider-config
     is created under it.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently

         ignored.

OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES
     The following optional attribute name/value pairs are avail-
     able:

     classname

         Defines the Java implementation class of  the  provider.
         Client   authentication  providers  must  implement  the
         com.sun.enterprise.      security.jauth.ClientAuthModule
         interface.  Server-side  providers  must  implement  the
         com.sun.enterprise.security       jauth.ServerAuthModule
         interface. A provider may implement both interfaces, but
         it must implement the  interface  corresponding  to  its
         provider type.

     layer
         The message-layer entity used to define the value of the
         auth-layer  attribute  of  message-security-config  ele-
         ments. The default is SOAP.

     providertype

         Establishes whether the provider is to be used as client
         authentication provider, server authentication provider,
         or both. Valid options for this property include client,
         server,  or  client-server. The default value is client-
         server.

     requestauthsource
         The auth-source  attribute  defines  a  requirement  for
         message-layer sender authentication (e.g. username pass-
         word) or content authentication (e.g. digital signature)
         to  be  applied to request messages. Possible values are
         sender or content. When this argument is not  specified,
         source authentication of the request is not required.

     requestauthrecipient

         The auth-recipient attribute defines a  requirement  for
         message-layer  authentication  of the receiver of a mes-
         sage to its sender (e.g. by  XML  encryption).  Possible
         values  are before-content or after-content. The default
         value is after-content.

     responseauthsource

         The auth-source  attribute  defines  a  requirement  for
         message-layer sender authentication (e.g. username pass-
         word) or content authentication (e.g. digital signature)
         to  be applied to response messages. Possible values are
         sender or content. When this option  is  not  specified,
         source authentication of the response is not required.

     responseauthrecipient
         The auth-recipient attribute defines a  requirement  for
         message-layer  authentication  of  the  receiver  of the
         response message to its sender (e.g. by XML encryption).
         Possible values are before-content or after-content. The
         default value is after-content.

     isdefaultprovider

         The default-provider attribute is used to designate  the
         provider  as  the default provider (at the layer) of the
         type or types identified by the  providertype  argument.
         There is no default associated with this option.

     property
         Use this property  to  pass  provider-specific  property
         values  to  the provider when it is initialized. Proper-
         ties passed in this way might include key aliases to  be
         used  by  the provider to get keys from keystores, sign-
         ing, canonicalization, encryption algorithms, etc.

OPERANDS
     provider_name

         The  name  of  the  provider  used  to   reference   the
         provider-config element.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using create-message-security-provider

     The following example shows how to create a message security
     provider for a client.
