/**
    The MBeanServer is optional (at least in theory).  For example, a lean production
    environment might choose to not load the management APIs (AMX) and therefore might not
    need the MBeanServer.
    <p>ï¿½the PlatformMBeanServer as returned
    by ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer(), this is <em>not</em> guaranteed.  Glassfish
    modules that require the MBeanServer should obtain it here.
    It might be that a single-server Glassfish would use
    the PlatformMBeanServer, but a clustered Glassfish might use a "wrapped" version to implement
    additional functionality, such as virtualization.  That "wrapped" version might not be the
    PlatformMBeanServer (default), but instead another MBeanServer entirely to avoid startup
    incompatibilities.
