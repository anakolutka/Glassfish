"The third theme of CDI is <emphasis>integration</emphasis>. We've already "
"seen how CDI helps integrate EJB and JSF, allowing EJBs to be bound directly"
" to JSF pages. That's just the beginning. The CDI services are integrated "
"into the very core of the Java EE platform. Even EJB session beans can take "
"advantage of the dependency injection, event bus, and contextual lifecycle "
"management that CDI provides."

"CDI is also designed to work in concert with technologies outside of the "
"platform by providing integration points into the Java EE platform via an "
"SPI. This SPI positions CDI as the foundation for a new ecosystem of "
"<emphasis>portable</emphasis> extensions and integration with existing "
"frameworks and technologies. The CDI services will be able to reach a "
"diverse collection of technologies, such as business process management "
"(BPM) engines, existing web frameworks and de facto standard component "
"models. Of course, The Java EE platform will never be able to standardize "
"all the interesting technologies that are used in the world of Java "
"application development, but CDI makes it easier to use the technologies "
"which are not yet part of the platform seamlessly within the Java EE "
"environment."

"Ya hemos visto cómo Web Beans ayuda a integrar EJB y JSF, permitiendo a los "
"EJB enlazarse directamente a páginas JSF. Esto es apenas el comienzo. Web "
"Beans ofrece el mismo potencial a otras tecnologías, tales como motores de "
"administración de proceso de negocios, otros marcos de red y modelos de "
"componentes de terceras partes. La plataforma de Java EE nunca podrá "
"estandarizar todas las tecnologías interesantes utilizadas en el mundo del "
"desarrollo de la aplicación Java, pero Web Beans facilita el uso de las "
"tecnologías que aún no hacen parte completamente de la plataforma dentro del"
" entorno Java EE."

"We're about to see how to take full advantage of the Java EE platform in an "
"application that uses CDI. We'll also briefly meet a set of SPIs that are "
"provided to support portable extensions to CDI. You might not ever need to "
"use these SPIs directly, but don't take them for granted. You will likely be"
" using them indirectly, every time you use a third-party extension, such as "
"Seam."
