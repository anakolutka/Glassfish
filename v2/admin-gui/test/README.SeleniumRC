How to run the Selenium based AdminTool JBI test cases:

1. Make sure that GlassFish app server (PE) is installed, up and running. 
	Test code assume that AdminTool is running
   on default port http://localhost:4848 
   #asadmin start-domain domain1
2. IE executable should be available at C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\IEXPLORE.exe
2a. The test runs with firefox browsers as well . Please make sure the correct line is 
    commented in JBITest to launch the right 
    browser. THe default location where firefox executable will be looked for is 
    c:\program files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe
3. Install JDK 5.0 update 11 in default location i.e. c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11
   3a. Set the selenium.home property in ../build.properties file.	
   3b. Download the following 3 selenium jar files from given location.	
	selenium-server-xyz-standalone.jar locations: (make sure jar has standalone in it)
	 http://maven.openqa.org/org/openqa/selenium/server/selenium-server/0.9.1-SNAPSHOT/
	selenium-java-client-driver 	  http://openqa.org/selenium-rc/download.action
	selenium-java-client-driver-tests http://openqa.org/selenium-rc/download.action
	And save them  in ${selenium.home}/lib directory
   3c. Download TestNG from http://testng.org/doc/download.html and copy the testng-5.5-jdk15.jar
	to ${selenium.home}/lib directory.
4. Open a command prompt (CP1), cd to ${selenium.home}/lib
4a. set Java_HOME and PATH environment variables
    #set JAVA_HOME=c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11
    #set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11;c:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.5.0_11\bin
5. Start the Selenium Remote server by typing the command after cd to ${selenium.home}\lib
   java -jar selenium-server-xyz-standalone.jar
6. cd  $Glassfishworkspace\glassfish\admin-gui;
	 ant test (invoke the new task in build.xml runs test as marked in testng.xml )
7. In case some statement fails to complete, you will mostly see first a hang browser 
	then a timedout exception on cmd line. Timed out exceptions could be
	ignored. But Element Not Found error should be investigated
        Please see command line to get the exact command which failed and the full trace.
	TestNG creates a test-output directory in admin-gui directory which has the result 
	of the test runs. As of April 25, 2007 the test results do not indicate the failed
	results correctly. (But all the checkedin tests pass in windows/chrome browser)
8. The Test assumes that Sun-Wsdl Shared Library and Java EE service Engine are installed
	in the JBI runtime already. If not, it causes failures in sorting the components 
	using Name Column header on list pages and selecting the right element in the table
	using select command .
