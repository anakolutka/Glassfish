This directory is supposed to contain the templates for configuration
and startup/shutdown scripts for application server PE and RI.

The directory contains master domain.xml templates for 8.0 PE and
xsl to transform master template to templates for more specialized
configuration, for example, RI (does not contain admingui) and
Sample domains (contains sample applications).

Several other configuration files that go to config directory of
application server domain are generated using templates in this
directory.

In addition, the directory also contains templates for the scripts
used to startup/shutdown application server instance (these scripts
go to the bin directory of the server).


The template files for other domains are generated during the build.
If you add a new xsl file (to generate another template), please be
sure to include in ../build.xml.

Due to licensing issues, it is important to note that cacerts.jks
should not be shipped with RI.
