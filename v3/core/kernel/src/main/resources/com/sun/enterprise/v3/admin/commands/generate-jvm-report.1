NAME
     generate-jvm-report - shows the  threads,  classes,  memory,
     and loggers for a given target instance.

SYNOPSIS
     generate-jvm-report
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --type =summary|memory|class|thread|log] [target]

DESCRIPTION
     This command  shows  the  threads  (dump  of  stack  trace),
     classes,  memory,  and  loggers for a given target instance,
     including the Domain Administration  Service.  This  command
     works  only  with the application server instance processes.
     This command replaces the traditional techniques like  send-
     ing  ctrl+break  or  kill  -3  signals to application server
     processes. The command will not work if  the  target  server
     instance is not running.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,

Administration Commands                    generate-jvm-report(1)

         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

Administration Commands                    generate-jvm-report(1)

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --type
         The type of report that is to be generated.

         summary

             Displays  summary  information  about  the  threads,
             classes, and memory.

         memory
             Provides information about heap and non-heap  memory
             consumption,  memory  pools,  and garbage collection
             statistics for a given target instance.

         class

             Provides information about the class  loader  for  a
             given target instance.

         thread
             Provides information about threads running  and  the
             thread   dump  (stack  trace)  for  a  given  target
             instance.

         log

             Provides information  about  the  loggers  that  are
             registered in the Virtual Machine TMr the Java plat-
             form (Java Virtual Machine or  JVM   machine).

             The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and  "JVM"  mean  a
             Virtual Machine for the Java platform.

OPERANDS
     target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.
