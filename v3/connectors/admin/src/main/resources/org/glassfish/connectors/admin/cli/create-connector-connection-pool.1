DESCRIPTION
     The create-connector-connection-pool adds  a  new  connector
     connection pool with the specified connection pool name.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,

Administration Commands       create-connector-connection-pool(1)

         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

Administration Commands       create-connector-connection-pool(1)

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         The target option is deprecated.

     --raname

         The name of the resource adapter.

     --connectiondefinition
         The name of the connection definition.

     --steadypoolsize

         The minimum and initial number of connections maintained
         in the pool. The default value is 8.

     --maxpoolsize
         The maximum number of connections that can be created to
         satisfy client requests. The default value is 32.

Administration Commands       create-connector-connection-pool(1)

     --maxwaittime

         The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a caller  must
         wait  before a connection is created, if a connection is
         not available. If set to 0, the caller is blocked  inde-
         finitely until a resource is available or until an error
         occurs. The default value is 60000.

     --poolresize
         Quantity by which the pool will scale-up  or  scale-down
         the  number  of connections. Scale-up: When the pool has
         no free connections, pool will scale-up  by  this  quan-
         tity.  Scale-down:  All the invalid and idle connections
         are removed, sometimes resulting in removing connections
         of  quantity greater than this value. The number of con-
         nections that is specified by --steadypoolsize  will  be
         ensured.  Possible values are from 0 to MAX_INTEGER. The
         default value is 2.

     --idletimeout

         The maximum time that a connection can  remain  idle  in
         the  pool. After this amount of time, the pool can close
         this connection. The default value is 300.

     --failconnection
         If set to true, all connections in the pool  are  closed
         if  a  single  validation check fails. This parameter is
         mandatory  if  the   --is-connection-validation-required
         option  is  set  to true. Legal values are on, off, yes,
         no, 1,0, true or false. The default value is false.

     --transactionsupport

         Indicates the level of  transaction  support  that  this
         pool  will  have.  Possible  values  are  XATransaction,
         LocalTransaction and NoTransaction. This  attribute  can
         have  a value lower than or equal to but not higher than
         the resource adapter's  transaction  support  attribute.
         The resource adapter's transaction support attribute has
         an order of values, where XATransaction is the  highest,
         and NoTransaction the lowest.

     --isconnectvalidatereq
         If the value is set to true,  the  connections  will  be
         checked to see if they are usable, before they are given
         out to the application. The default value is false.
