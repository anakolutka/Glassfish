<a name="jdbcconnectionpooladvance"></a><h4>To edit JDBC Connection Pool Advanced Attributes</h4><p>To help diagnose connection leaks and improve ease-of&ndash;use, Application Server 9.1 provides several
new attributes to configure a connection pool at the time of its creation.</p><ol>
<li><b>Specify the advanced attributes as explained in the following table.</b><table><tr><td><p>Attribute</p></td>
<td><p>Description</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Name</p></td>
<td><p>Name of the JDBC
connection pool.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Statement Timeout</p></td>
<td><p>Time in seconds after which abnormally long running queries will be
terminated. Application Server will set  "QueryTimeout" on the statements created. The default
value of -1 implies that the attribute is not enabled.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Wrap JDBC Objects</p></td>
<td><p>When set
to true, application will get wrapped jdbc objects for Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement, ResultSet,
DatabaseMetaData. The default value is false.</p></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><b>Specify the Connection Settings as explained in the following table. </b><table><tr><td><p>Attribute</p></td>
<td><p>Description</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Validate Atmost Once</p></td>
<td><p>Amount
of time, in seconds, after which a connection is validated at most once.
This will help reduce the number of validation requests by a connection. The
default value 0 implies that connection validation is not enabled.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Leak Timeout</p></td>
<td><p>Amount of time,
in seconds, to trace connection leaks in a connection pool. The default value
0 means that connection leak tracing is disabled. If connection leak tracing is
enabled, you can get statistics on the number of connection leaks in the
Monitoring Resources tab. To view this tab, go to Application Server > Monitoring
> Resources. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Leak Reclaim</p></td>
<td><p>If this option is enabled, leaked connections will be
restored to the pool after leak connection tracing is complete.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Creation Retry Attempts</p></td>
<td><p>Number of
attempts that will be made if there is a failure in creating a
new connection. The default value of 0 implies that no attempts will be
made to create the connection again.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Retry Interval</p></td>
<td><p>Specify the interval, in seconds, between
two attempts to create a connection. The default value is 10 seconds. This
attribute is used only if the value of Creation Retry Attempts is greater
than 0.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Lazy Connection Enlistment</p></td>
<td><p>Enable this option to enlist a resource to the
transaction only when it is actually used in a method.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Lazy Association</p></td>
<td><p>Connections are lazily
associated when an operation is  performed on them. Also, they are disassociated
when the  transaction is completed and a component method ends, which 
helps reuse of the physical connections. Default value is  false.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Associate with Thread</p></td>
<td><p>Enable
this option to associate a connection with the thread such that when the
same thread is in need of a connection, it can reuse the connection
already associated with that thread, thereby not incurring the overhead of getting a
connection from the pool. Default value is false.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Match Connections </p></td>
<td><p>Use this option to
switch on/off connection matching for the pool. It can be set to false
if the administrator knows that the connections in the pool will always be
homogeneous and hence a connection picked from the pool need not be matched
by the resource adapter. Default value is false.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Max Connection Usage</p></td>
<td><p>Specify the number of
times a connection should be reused by the pool. Once a connection is
reused for the specified number of times, it will be closed. This is
useful, for instance, to avoid statement-leaks. The default value of 0 implies that
this attribute is not enabled.</p></td>
</tr>
</table></li></ol>
