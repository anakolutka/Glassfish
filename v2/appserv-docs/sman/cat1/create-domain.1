DESCRIPTION
     Use the create-domain command to  create  an  administrative
     domain.

     This  command creates  the  configuration  of  a  domain.  A
     domain  is  an  administrative namespace. Every domain has a
     configuration, which is stored in a set of files. Any number
     of domains each of which has a distinct administrative iden-
     tity can be created in a given installation  of  application
     server.  A  domain  can exist  independent of other domains.
     Any user who has access to the asadmin script  on  a   given
     system  can create a domain and store its configuration in a
     folder of choice. By default, the  domain  configuration  is
     created  in the default directory for domains. You can over-
     ride this location to store the configuration elsewhere.

     A domain, in addition to being an  administrative  boundary,
     is also a
      fully compliant Java EE Server. This means that you can can
     deploy your Java EE  Applications to the domain and run them
     when the domain is  started.  A  domain  provides  all   the
     necessary environment and services that are essential to run
     the applications.

     A domain can be managed by tools such as the  Administration
     GUI or asadmin.

     You choose an appropriate profile for the domain,  depending
     on  the applications that youwant to run on your new domain.
     You can choose the developer, cluster, or enterprise profile
     for the domain you create.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --user
           The username of the adminstrator of the domain.

     -t --terse

           Indicates that any output data must be  very  concise,
           typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favor-
           ing well-formatted data for consumption by  a  script.
           Default is false.

     -e --echo
           Setting to true will echo the command  line  statement
           on the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive
           If set to true (default), only the  required  password
           options are prompted.

     --domaindir
           The directory where the domain is to  be  created.  If
           specified, the path must be accessible in the filesys-
           tem. If not specified, the domain is  created  in  the
           default domain directory.

     --profile
           The profile of the domain. A usage profile depicts how
           a particular domain is going to be used. It determines
           how   the   templates   for    various    files    are
           customized.Currently,   only   the  customization  for
           domain.xml template is supported.

          Note:

          We will modify this after Beta.
          Valid values for this option are:

             o  developer: Use this profile if  you  are  running
                your  domain  in a development environment and if
                your  applications   do   not   need   enterprise
                features,  such as clustering, high availability,
                NSS keystore, or session replication.

             o  cluster: Use this profile if you need  to  create
                clusters  but  do  not  require high availability
                features or NSS keystore.

             o  enterprise: Use this  profile  if  you  need  all
                enterprise  features.   The default value of this
                option for a given installation is determined  by
                the     AS_ADMIN_PROFILE    variable    in    the
                asadminenv.conf file.

          Note:

          Profile names are case-sensitive. Use all profile names
          in lower case only.

     --template
           The file name of a domain.xml template used to  create
           the  domain. This allows domains of different types to
           be created. This also allows you to  define  your  own
           template.

     --adminport
           The HTTP/S port for  administration. This is the  port
           to  which  you  should  point  your browser  (example,
           http://localhost:<this-port>) to  manage  the  domain.
           This  option  is  mandatory unless you specify a value
           for the --portbase option.

     --passwordfile
           The file  containing  the  domain  application  server
           password  associated with the administrative instance.
           The   create-domain   command   reads    values    for
           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD and the AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD from
           this file. The password is defined  in  the  following
           form:  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,  where  password is
           the actual administrator password for the domain. This
           file  can contain many other passwords required by the
           asadmin commands.  In adherence to application  server
           security  policy,  asadmin  does not accept clear text
           passwords on the command line.

           If AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD and  AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD  are
           not in the passwordfile, create-domain command prompts
           for  admin   password   and   master   password.    If
           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  is  present  in  the  file  that is
           passed into ---passwordfile option, the  create-domain
           command  does  not  prompt for the master password. In
           this case,  AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD  defaults  to  the
           value, changeit.

           Additionally, you may omit the --passwordfile from the
           command  line  and  allow the system to prompt you for
           these options.

     -t --terse
           Indicates that any output data must be  very  concise,
           typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favor-
           ing well-formatted data for consumption by  a  script.
           Default is false.

     --instanceport
           As noted above, the  domain provides services so  that
           applications  can  run when deployed. This (HTTP) port
           specifies where the  web application context roots are
           available  for  a Web browser to connect to. This port
           is a positive integer and must  be  available  at  the
           time of creation of the domain.

     --savemasterpassword
           Setting this option to true allows the  masterpassword
           to be written to the file system. A master password is
           really a password for the secure key store.  A  domain
           is  designed  to keep  its own certificate (created at
           the time of domain creation) in a safe place  in   the
           configuration  location.  This  certificate  is called
           domain's SSL server certificate. When the   domain  is
           contacted  by  a  Web  browser  over  a secure channel
           (HTTPS), this certificate is presented by the  domain.
           The master password is supposed to protect this  store
           (a file) that contains this certificate. This file  is
           called  keystore.jks  and  is   created  in the config
           directory of the  domain  created.  If  however,  this
           option is  chosen, the master password is saved on the
           disk in domain's configuration location.  The   master
           password  is  stored in a file called master-password,
           which is a Java JCEKS type  keystore. The only  advan-
           tage  of  using  this  option is in case of unattended
           system  boots, where at the time of start-domain,  the
           master  password is not prompted for,  because it will
           be extracted from this file.

           It is best to create a masterpassword when creating  a
           domain,  because  masterpassword is used by the start-
           domain command. For  security  purposes,  the  default
           setting  should  be  false, because saving the master-
           password on the disk is an insecure  practice,  unless
           file  system  permissions are properly set. If master-
           password is saved, then start-domain will  not  prompt
           for  it.  Masterpassword gives an extra level of secu-
           rity to the environment.

     --domainproperties
           Setting the optional name/value  pairs  overrides  the
           default  values for the properties of the domain to be
           created. The list must be separated by the ":" charac-
           ter. The following properties are available:

              o  jms.port: Specifies the  port  number  for  JMS.
                 Valid value is 7676.

              o  jms.port: Specifies the  port  number  for  JMS.
                 Valid value is 7676.

              o  jms.port: Specifies the  port  number  for  JMS.
                 Valid value is 7676.

              o  jdomain.jmxPort: Specifies the port on which the
                 JMX  connector is  initialized. The valid values
                 are 1-65535.



              o  orb.listener.port: Specifies  the  ORB  listener
                 port    for   IIOP  connections  on  which  orb-
                 listener-1 listens .

              o  http.ssl.port: Specifies  the  port  number  for
                 http-listener-2.   Valid  values are 1 to 65535.
                 On UNIX, to create sockets that listen on  ports
                 1-1024, you need superuser privileges.

              o  orb.ssl.port: Specifies the  ORB  listener  port
                 for  IIOP connections on which the IIOP listener
                 called SSL listens.

              o  orb.mutualauth.port: Specifies the ORB  listener
                 port  for  IIOP  connections  on  which the IIOP
                 listener called SSL_MUTUALAUTH listens.

     --portbase
           Determines the number with which the  port  assignment
           should  start. A domain uses a certain number of ports
           that are  statically  assigned.   The  portbase  value
           determines  where  the assignment should start. Choose
           this value judiciously. The values for the  ports  are
           calculated as follows: Admin port: portbase + 48, HTTP
           listener port: portbase  +  80,  IIOP  listener  port:
           portbase + 37, JMX port: portbase + 86. See the output
           of this command for a complete list of occupied ports,
           when --portbase option is specified.

          Note:

          The --portbase  option  cannot  be  used  with  the  --
          adminport or the --instanceport option.

      --savelogin
           Saves the admin user name and password if you set this
           option  to true. The default value is false. The user-
           name and password are stored in the .asadminpass  file
           in user's home directory. A domain can only be created
           locally and hence while using the  above  option,  the
           host   name  saved  in  .asadminpass  will  always  be
           localhost. If the user  has  specified  default  admin
           port  while  creating  the domain, there is no need to
           specify --user, --passwordfile, --host, or  --port  on
           any  of the subsequent asadmin remote commands.  These
           values will be automatically obtained.

          Note:

          When the same user creates multiple domains having same
          admin  port  number  on  the same or different machines
          (where the home directory is NFS mounted), the  command

          is  not  going to prompt whether the password should be
          overwritten. It will always be overwritten.

OPERANDS
     domain_name
           The name of the domain to be created.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the create-domain command  (developer  pro-
     file)

     The following command creates domain4 domain with  developer
     profile.

     asadmin>create-domain --adminport 4848 --profile developer domain4
     Please enter the admin user name>admin
     Please enter the admin password>
     Please enter the admin password again>
     Please enter the master password>
     Please enter the master password again>
     Using port 4848 for Admin.
     Using default port 8080 for HTTP Instance.
     Using default port 7676 for JMS.
     Using default port 3700 for IIOP.
     Using default port 8181 for HTTP_SSL.
     Using default port 3820 for IIOP_SSL.
     Using default port 3920 for IIOP_MUTUALAUTH.
     Using default port 8686 for JMX_ADMIN.
     Domain being created with profile:developer, as specified on command line or environment.
     Security Store used should be JKS
     Domain domain4 created.

     Example 2: Using the create-domain command (enterprise  pro-
     file)

     The  following  command  creates  sampleDomain  domain  with
     enterprise profile in the /export/domains directory.

     asadmin>  create-domain --domaindir /export/domains --adminport 7070 --adminuser admin --instanceport 7071 sampleDomain
     Please enter the admin password>
     Please enter the admin password again>
     Please enter the master password>
     Please enter the master password again>
     Using port 7070 for Admin.
     Using default port 8080 for HTTP Instance.
     Using default port 7676 for JMS.
     Using default port 3700 for IIOP.
     Using default port 8181 for HTTP_SSL.
     Using default port 3820 for IIOP_SSL.
     Using default port 3920 for IIOP_MUTUALAUTH.
     Using default port 8686 for JMX_ADMIN.
     Domain being created with profile:enterprise, as specified by variable AS_ADMIN_PROFILE in configuration file.

     Security Store used should be NSS
     Domain sampleDomain created.

          Note:

          In this example, the domain,  sampleDomain,  takes  the
          enterprise  profile though the ---profile option is not
          specified, because AS_ADMIN_PROFILE in  the  configura-
          tion file is set to enterprise profile.

     Example 3: Using the create-domain command (savelogin)

     The following command creates the myDomain domain  with  the
     enterprise  profile  and  saves the admin username and pass-
     word.

     asadmin>  create-domain --adminport 8282 --adminuser admin --savelogin=true myDomain
     Please enter the admin user name>admin
     Please enter the admin password>
     Please enter the admin password again>
     Please enter the master password>
     Please enter the master password again>
     Using port 8282 for Admin.
     Using default port 8080 for HTTP Instance.
     Using default port 7676 for JMS.
     Using default port 3700 for IIOP.
