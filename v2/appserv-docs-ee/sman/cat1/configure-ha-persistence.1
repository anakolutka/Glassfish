DESCRIPTION
     Configure the global session persistence settings to balance
     your needs for performance, reliability, and high availabil-
     ity. You can override these settings for  specific  applica-
     tions  by changing the properties of the manager-properties,
     store-properties, and session-properties subelements of  the
     session-manager element in the sun-web.xml file.

     The configure-ha-persistence command is  available  only  in
     the  Enterprise  Edition  of the Sun Java System Application
     Server.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can

                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --type                  Set the persistence type to  specify
                             where  session  data  is stored. The
                             persistence types available are:

                               o  memory If  session  persistence
                                  for   the   application  server
                                  instance is disabled,  this  is
                                  the  default  persistence type.
                                  The  memory  persistence   type
                                  provides no session persistence
                                  in a clustered environment. The
                                  memory   persistence   type  is
                                  intended    for     development
                                  environments  and should not be
                                  used for production.

                               o  file This type provides no ses-
                                  sion persistence in a clustered
                                  environment.  Use   file   per-
                                  sistence  type to store session
                                  data in a file. If the instance
                                  becomes  unavailable  and  res-
                                  tarts, it can recover the  ses-
                                  sion  information that was last
                                  written to the file.  The  file
                                  persistence  type  is meant for
                                  development  environments   and
                                  should  not be used for produc-
                                  tion.

                               o  ha If session  persistence  for
                                  the application server instance
                                  is enabled, this is the default
                                  persistence   type.  This  type
                                  allows  you  to  store  session
                                  data  in  the HADB. The ha per-
                                  sistence type enables  failover
                                  of ses sion information between
                                  application server instances in
                                  a cluster. The session informa-
                                  tion   for   each   application
                                  server  instance  in a clus ter
                                  is stored in the HADB. The ses-
                                  sion  information  is available
                                  to all other instances  in  the
                                  cluster.  If  an  instance in a
                                  cluster  becomes   unavailable,
                                  another instance in the cluster
                                  can continue to serve the  ses-
                                  sions  that the now unavailable
                                  instance was serving.

     --frequency             Set  the  persistence  frequency  to
                             define  the  frequency  at which the
                             session state is stored in the HADB.
                             The  persistence  frequencies avail-
                             able are:

                               o  web-method   The   session   is
                                  stored  after every web request
                                  just before a response is  sent
                                  back  to  the  client. Use this
                                  frequency when  you  need  very
                                  high  availability  of  updated
                                  session  states.  This  is  the
                                  default.

                               o  time-based   The   session   is
                                  stored  at  the  time  interval
                                  defined  in  the  reapInterval-
                                  Seconds   property.   A  better
                                  throughput is achieved  because
                                  the  session  is stored after a
                                  configurable   time    interval
                                  instead   of  after  every  web
                                  request.

     --scope                 Set the persistence scope to  deter-
                             mine  how  much  of  the  session is
                             stored.   The   persistence   scopes
                             available are:

                               o  modified-session   The   entire
                                  session  is  stored  only if it
                                  has  been  modified  since  the
                                  last time it was stored.

                               o  session The entire  session  is
                                  stored   every   time   session
                                  information  is  saved  to  the
                                  HADB. This is the default.

                               o  modified-attribute   Only   the
                                  modified attributes of the ses-
                                  sion  are  stored.  Using  this
                                  mode can improve the throughput
                                  and response time significantly
                                  for  applications in which only
                                  a small portion of the  session
                                  state is modified for any given

                                  request.

                             If you  use  the  modified-attribute
                             persistence  scope, your application
                             should follow these guidelines:

                               o  Call setAttribute() every  time
                                  you modify the session state.

                               o  Make sure there are  no  cross-
                                  references  between attributes.
                                  The  object  graph  under  each
                                  distinct attribute key is seri-
                                  alized and  stored  separately.
                                  If  there  are any object cross
                                  references between the  objects
                                  under  each  separate key, they
                                  are not serialized and  deseri-
                                  alized correctly.

                               o  Ideally,  the   session   state
                                  should  be  stored  in multiple
                                  attributes, or at  least  in  a
                                  read-only   attribute   and   a
                                  modifiable attribute.

     --store                 Specify the JNDI name  of  the  JDBC
                             resource  for  the HADB. The default
                             is jdbc/hastore.

     --property              Specify  other  session  persistence
                             properties.

OPERANDS
     clustername             Specify the name of the cluster  for
                             which  you  are  configuring session
                             persistence.
