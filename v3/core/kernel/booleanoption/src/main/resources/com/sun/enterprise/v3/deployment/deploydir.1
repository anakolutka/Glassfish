DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to deploy an application  directly  from  a
     development  directory.  The appropriate directory hierarchy
     and deployment descriptors conforming to the Java EE specif-
     ication must exist in the deployment directory.

     Directory deployment is for advanced developers only. Do not
     use  it  in  production environments. In production environ-
     ments, use the deploy command. Directory deployment is  only
     supported  on localhost, that is, the client and server must
     reside on the same machine. For this reason, the only values
     for the --host option are:

         o    localhost

         o    The value of the $HOSTNAME environment variable

         o    The IP address of the machine

     If   the   --uniquetablenames,   --createtables,   and    --
     dropandcreatetables  options  are not specified, the entries
     in the deployment descriptors are used.

     The --force option makes sure the  component  is  forcefully
     (re)deployed  even  if  the  specified component has already
     been deployed or already exists. Set --force to false for  a
     first  deployment. If the application with that name is run-
     ning and force is set to false, the command fails.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse                          Indicates that any  out-
                                         put  data  must  be very
                                         concise,       typically
                                         avoiding  human-friendly
                                         sentences  and  favoring
                                         well-formatted  data for
                                         consumption by a script.
                                         Default is false.

     -e --echo                           Setting  to  true   will
                                         echo  the  command  line
                                         statement on  the  stan-
                                         dard  output. Default is
                                         false.

     -I --interactive                    If    set    to     true
                                         (default),    only   the
                                         required        password
                                         options are prompted.

     -H --host                           The machine  name  where
                                         the  domain  administra-
                                         tion server is  running.
                                         The   default  value  is
                                         localhost.

     -p --port                           The  HTTP/S   port   for
                                         administration.  This is
                                         the port  to  which  you
                                         should     point    your
                                         browser  in   order   to
                                         manage  the  domain. For
                                         example,
                                         http://localhost:4848.

                                         The default port  number
                                         is 4848.

     -s --secure                         If  set  to  true,  uses
                                         SSL/TLS  to  communicate
                                         with the domain adminis-
                                         tration server.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the deploydir command

     The  exploded  application  to  be  deployed   is   in   the
     /home/temp/sampleApp  directory.  Since  the force option is
     set to true, if an application of that name already  exists,
     the application is redeployed.
