This test, when run with 'all' target performs the following steps:

- build
- setup
  - start-database
  - startDomain
  - setup-database (add jdbc resources and execute create.sql script on 2 resources + tx logs resource "jdbc/nontx")

- run
  - setup-cluster (create cluster of 2 instances, enable resources in the cluster, enable db-based tx logging, and deploy the application)
  - run-delegated (execute test for automatic transactions recover as a GMS notification handling)
    Test inserts 3 rows from in1 into the default and xa database
    Instance in1 is killed and restarted
    Sleep 35 seconds to allow for all processing to go through
    Expected result: 3 rows found in xa database when verified from in2
  - reset (unsetup-cluster, reset-tables, setup-cluster)
  - run-cli (execute the same test with CLI-based delegated recovery) 

- unsetup
  - unsetup-cluster (undeploy the application, stop and delete the cluster)
  - unsetup-database (drop tables and remove resources)
  - stop-database
  - stopDomain
