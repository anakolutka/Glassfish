DESCRIPTION
     Creates and configures the SSL element in the selected  HTTP
     listener,  IIOP  listener,  or IIOP service to enable secure
     communication on that listener/service.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile
         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --type

         The type of service or listener for  which  the  SSL  is
         created. The type can be:

             o    http-listener

             o    iiop-listener

             o    iiop-service

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

         When the type  is  iiop-service,  the  ssl-client-config
         along  with  the  embedded  ssl  element  is  created in
         domain.xml.

     --certname

         The nickname of the server certificate in  the  certifi-
         cate  database  or  the PKCS#11 token. The format of the
         name in the certificate is tokenname:nickname. For  this
         property, the tokenname: is optional.

     --ssl2enabled
         Set this property to true to enable  SSL2.  The  default
         value  is false. If both SSL2 and SSL3 are enabled for a
         virtual server, the server tries SSL3 encryption  first.
         In  the  event  SSL3  encryption  fails, the server then
         tries SSL2 encryption.

     --ssl2ciphers

         A comma-separated list of the SSL2 ciphers to  be  used.
         Use  the prefix + to enable or - to disable a particular
         cipher. Allowed values are:

             o    rc4

             o    rc4export

             o    rc2

             o    rc2export

             o    idea

             o    des

             o    desede3
         If no value is  specified,  all  supported  ciphers  are
         assumed to be enabled.

     --ssl3enabled
         Set this property to false to disable SSL3. The  default
         value  is  true. If both SSL2 and SSL3 are enabled for a
         virtual server, the server tries SSL3 encryption  first.
         In  the  event  SSL3  encryption  fails, the server then
         tries SSL2 encryption.

     --tlsenabled

         Set this property to false to disable TLS.  The  default
         value  is  true It is good practice to enable TLS, which
         is a more secure version of SSL.

     --ssl3tlsciphers
         A comma-separated list of the SSL3 and/or TLS ciphers to
         be  used.  Use  the prefix + to enable or - to disable a
         particular cipher. Allowed values are:

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
         If no value is  specified,  all  supported  ciphers  are
         assumed to be enabled.

     --tlsrollbackenabled

         Set to true (default) to enable TLS rollback. TLS  roll-
         back  should  be enabled for Microsoft Internet Explorer
         5.0  and  5.5.  This   option   is   only   valid   when
         -tlsenabled=true.

     --clientauthenabled
         Set to true if you want  SSL3 client authentication per-
         formed  on every request independent of ACL-based access
         control. Default value is false.

OPERANDS
     listener_id

          The ID of the HTTP or IIOP listener for which  the  SSL
         element  is  to  be  created.  The  listener_id  is  not
         required if the --type is iiop-service.
