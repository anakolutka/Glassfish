DESCRIPTION
     The create-javamail-resource command creates a JavaMail ses-
     sion  resource.  This  command  is  supported in remote mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,

                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the

                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                This option specifies the target for
                             which  you are creating the JavaMail
                             session resource. Valid values are:

                               o  server,   which   creates   the
                                  resource for the default server
                                  instance. This is  the  default
                                  value.

                               o  domain,   which   creates   the
                                  resource for the domain

                               o  cluster_name, which creates the
                                  resource   for   every   server
                                  instance in the cluster

                               o  instance_name,  which   creates
                                  the  resource  for a particular
                                  server instance

                             This option is available only in the

                             Sun  Java  System Application Server
                             Standard and Enterprise Editions.

     --mailhost              The DNS name  of  the  default  mail
                             server.  The  connect methods of the
                             Store and Transport objects use this
                             value  if  a  protocol-specific host
                             property is not supplied.  The  name
                             must be resolvable to an actual host
                             name.

     --mailuser              The name of the  mail  account  user
                             provided  when  connecting to a mail
                             server. The connect methods  of  the
                             Store and Transport objects use this
                             value if a  protocol-specific  user-
                             name property is not supplied.

     --fromaddress           The email  address  of  the  default
                             user,        in       the       form
                             username@host.domain.

     --storeprotocol         The mail server store protocol.  The
                             default  is imap.  Change this value
                             only if you  have  reconfigured  the
                             Application  Server's  mail provider
                             to use a nondefault store protocol.

     --storeprotocolclass    The mail server store protocol class
                             name.       The      default      is
                             com.sun.mail.imap.IMAPStore.  Change
                             this  value  only if you have recon-
                             figured  the  Application   Server's
                             mail  provider  to  use a nondefault
                             store protocol.

     --transprotocol         The mail server transport  protocol.
                             The  default  is  smtp.  Change this
                             value only if you have  reconfigured
                             the    Application   Server's   mail

                             provider to use a  nondefault  tran-
                             sport protocol.

     --transprotocolclass    The mail server  transport  protocol
                             class    name.    The   default   is
                             com.sun.mail.smtp.SMTPTransport.
                             Change  this  value only if you have
                             reconfigured     the     Application
                             Server's mail provider to use a non-
                             default transport protocol.

     --debug                 If set to true, the server starts up
                             in  debug mode for this resource. If
                             the JavaMail log  level  is  set  to
                             FINE  or FINER, the debugging output
                             will  be  generated  and   will   be
                             included in the server log file. The
                             default value is false.

     --enabled               If set  to  true,  the  resource  is
                             enabled   at  runtime.  The  default
                             value is true.

     --description            Text providing some details of  the
                             JavaMail resource.

     --property              Optional attribute name/value  pairs
                             for    configuring    the   JavaMail
                             resource. The JavaMail API  documen-
                             tation   lists  the  properties  you
                             might want to set.

OPERANDS
     jndi_name               The  JNDI  name  of   the   JavaMail
                             resource  to  be  created.  It  is a
                             recommended practice to use the nam-
                             ing   subcontext  prefix  mail/  for
                             JavaMail resources.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the create-javamail-resource command

     The following command  creates  a  JavaMail  resource  named
     mail/MyMailSession.  The escape character (\) is used in the
     --fromaddress option to distinguish the dot (.) and at  sign
     (@).  The  JNDI  name  for  a JavaMail session resource cus-
     tomarily includes the mail/ naming subcontext.
