     the specified connector connection pool

DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to create a security map for the  specified
     connector  connection  pool.  If  the  security  map  is not
     present, a new one is created.  Also, use  this  command  to
     map  the  caller  identity  of the application (principal or
     user group) to a suitable EIS principal in container-managed
     transaction-based scenarios. One or more named security maps
     may be associated with a connector connection pool. The con-
     nector  security  map  configuration supports the use of the
     wild card asterisk (*) to indicate all  users  or  all  user
     groups.

     For this command to succeed, you must have first  created  a
     connector   connection   pool  using  the  create-connector-
     connection-pool command.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are

                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include

                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                This option is  deprecated  in  this
                             release.

     --poolname              Specifies the name of the  connector
                             connection   pool   to   which   the

                             security map belongs.

     --principals            Specifies  a  list  of  backend  EIS
                             principals.  More than one principal
                             can  be  specified  using  a   comma
                             separated  list.  Use  either the --
                             principals or --usergroups  options,
                             but not both.

     --usergroups            Specifies a list of backend EIS user
                             group.  More than one usergroups can
                             be specified using a comma separated
                             list.

     --mappedusername         This  property  specifies  the  EIS
                             username.

OPERANDS
     security_map_name        name of  the  security  map  to  be
                             created or updated.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using create-connector-security-map command

     It is assumed that  the  connector  pool  has  already  been
     created using the create-connector-pool command.

     asadmin> create-connector-security-map --user admin
     --passwordfile pwd_file.txt --poolname connector-pool1 --principals principal1, principal2 --mappedusername backend-username securityMap1
     Command create-connector-security-map executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
     0                        command executed successfully

     1                        error in executing the command
