OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --droptables            If set to true,  tables  created  by
                             application  using  CMP beans during
                             deployment are dropped. The  default
                             is  the  corresponding  entry in the
                             cmp-resource  element  of  the  sun-
                             ejb-jar.xml  file. If not specified,
                             it defaults to the entries specified
                             in the deployment descriptors.

     --cascade               If set to true, it deletes  all  the
                             connection   pools   and   connector
                             resources   associated   with    the
                             resource  adapter  being undeployed.
                             If set to false, the undeploy  fails
                             if any pools and resources are still
                             associated   with    the    resource
                             adapter.  Then,  either  those pools
                             and resources  have  to  be  deleted
                             explicitly,  or the option has to be
                             set to true. If the option is set to
                             false, and if there are no pools and
                             resources still associated with  the
                             resource   adapter,   the   resource
                             adapter is undeployed.  This  option
                             is    applicable    to    connectors

                             (resource  adapters)  and   applica-
                             tions.

     --target                This option is available only in the
                             Sun  Java  System Application Server
                             Standard       and        Enterprise
                             Editions.Specifies  the  target from
                             which you  are  undeploying.   Valid
                             values are:

                               o  server,  which  undeploys   the
                                  component   from   the  default
                                  server instance server  and  is
                                  the default value

                               o  domain,  which  undeploys   the
                                  component from the domain.

                               o  cluster_name,  which  undeploys
                                  the component from every server
                                  instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name, which  undeploys
                                  the component from a particular
                                  sever instance.

OPERANDS
     component_name          Name of the deployed component.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Simple undeployment

     Undeploy (uninstall) an enterprise application Cart.ear.

     asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt Cart

     cascading delete to remove the associated resources and con-
     nection pools.

     asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt --cascade=true jdbcra
     Command undeploy executed successfully.
