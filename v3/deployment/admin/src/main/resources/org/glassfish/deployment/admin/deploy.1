DESCRIPTION
     Deploys an  enterprise  application,  web  application,  EJB
     module,  connector  module, or application client module. If
     the component is already deployed or already exists,  it  is
     forcibly redeployed if the --force option is set to true.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

     -H --host

         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port
         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --virtualservers
         One  or  more  virtual  server  IDs.  Multiple  IDs  are
         separated by commas.

     --contextroot

         Valid only if the archive is a web module. It is ignored
         for  other  archive  types; defaults to filename without
         extension.

     --force
         If set to true, makes sure the component  is  redeployed
         even   if  the  specified  component  has  already  been

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

         deployed or already exists. The default is false.

     --precompilejsp

         By default this option is set to false, which  does  not
         allow  the JSP to pre-compile during deployment. Instead
         JSPs are compiled during runtime.

     --verify
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --name

         Name of the deployable component.

     --upload
         When set to true (the default), uploads  the  deployable
         file  to  the administration server. The deployable file
         must be accessible from  the  client.  If  the  file  is
         accessible  to  both server and client, set the --upload
         option to false.

     --retrieve

         Retrieves the client  stub  JAR  file  from  the  server
         machine to the local directory.

     --dbvendorname
         Specifies the name of  the  database  vendor  for  which
         tables are created. Supported values include db2, mssql,
         oracle,  derby,  javadb,  postgresql,   pointbase,   and
         sybase, case-insensitive. If not specified, the value of
         the database-vendor-name attribute in sun-ejb-jar.xml is
         used.  If no value is specified, a connection is made to
         the resource specified by the  jndi-name  subelement  of
         the  cmp-resource  element  in the sun-ejb-jar.xml file,
         and the database vendor name is read. If the  connection
         cannot  be  established,  or  if the value is not recog-
         nized, SQL-92 compliance is presumed.

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

     --createtables

         Creates tables at  deployment  of  an  application  with
         unmapped  CMP  beans.  Default  is the create-tables-at-
         deploy entry in the cmp-resource  element  of  the  sun-
         ejb-jar.xml file.

     --dropandcreatetables
         If set to true, when the component  is  redeployed,  the
         tables  created  by  the previous deployment are dropped
         before creating  the  new  tables.  Applies  to  already
         deployed  applications  with  unmapped CMP beans. If not
         set to true, the tables are dropped if the  drop-tables-
         at-undeploy  entry  in  the  cmp-resource element of the
         sun-ejb-jar.xml file is set to true. The new tables  are
         created  if  the  create-tables-at-deploy  entry  in the
         cmp-resource element of the sun-ejb-jar.xml file is  set
         to true.

     --uniquetablenames

         Guarantees unique table names  for  all  the  beans  and
         results  in a hashcode added to the table names. This is
         useful if you have an  application  with  case-sensitive
         bean names.

     --deploymentplan
         Takes the deployment plan, which  is  a  JAR  containing
         Sun-specific descriptors, and deploys it. This should be
         passed along when deploying a pure EAR file. A pure  EAR
         file is an EAR without Sun-specific descriptors.

     --enabled

         If set to true (default), allows  users  to  access  the
         application.  If set to false, users will not be able to
         access the application. In a domain whose profile is the
         cluster  profile  or the enterprise profile, this option
         enables the application on the specified target instance
         or  cluster.  If  you  deploy to the target domain, this
         option is ignored, since deploying to the domain doesn't
         deploy to a specific instance or cluster.

     --generatermistubs
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error  does  not  occur.  Instead,  the

         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --availabilityenabled

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --libraries
         A comma-separated list of library JAR files. Specify the
         library  JAR  files by their relative or absolute paths.
         Specify   relative   paths   relative    to    instance-
         root/lib/applibs.  The  libraries  are made available to
         the application in the order specified.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --type
         The packaging archive type  of  the  component  that  is
         being deployed. Possible values are as follows:

         osgi

             The component is packaged as an OSGI  Alliance  bun-
             dle.

         The --type option is optional. If the component is pack-
         aged as a regular archive, omit this option.

     --properties --property
         Optional keyword-value  pairs  that  specify  additional
         properties  for the deployment. The available properties
         are determined by the implementation  of  the  component
         that is being deployed.

         Note -

           The --properties option and the --property option  are

           equivalent.  You  can  use either option regardless of
           the number of properties that you specify.

OPERANDS
     filepath

         Path to the deployable file on the local client  machine
         if the upload option is set to true; otherwise the abso-
         lute path to the file on the server machine.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Deploying an Enterprise Application

     This syntax deploys the enterprise application  packaged  in
     the Cart.ear file.

       asadmin> deploy --user admin --passwordfile filename Cart.ear
       Command deploy executed successfully

     Example 2 Deploying a Web Application With the Default  Con-
     text Root

     This syntax deploys the web  application  in  the  hello.war
     file.

       asadmin> deploy --user admin --passwordfile myfile hello.war
       Command deploy executed successfully

     Example 3  Forcibly  Deploying  a  Web  Application  With  a
     Specific Context Root

     This syntax  forcibly deploys the  web  application  in  the
     hello.war  file. The context root of the deployed web appli-
     cation is greetings. If the  application  has  already  been
     deployed, it is redeployed.

       asadmin> deploy --user admin --passwordfile myfile --force=true
       --contextroot greetings hello.war
       Command deploy executed successfully
