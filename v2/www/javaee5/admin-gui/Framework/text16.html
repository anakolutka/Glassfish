<ul><li><h2>ViewDescriptors</h2>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
The XML parser reads all the displayItems, instantiates the appropriate ViewDescriptor (based on the “type” attribute), and caches them in a static HashMap.<br>
<br>
IT IS IMPORTANT NOT TO MODIFY VIEW DESCRIPTORS VIA JAVA.<br>
<br>
ViewDescriptors each provide a factory method “getInstance” that is responsible for instantiating the corresponding View object.  This greatly simplifies View creation, especially for ViewBeans (ViewBeans in standard JATO must exist in the particular package tied to the Servlet – that restriction is removed with these factory methods).  NOTE: this method is called internally w/i the framework from the “createChild” method, invoking it directly will return a new instance (not what you want).  There are several other ways to get the corresponding View object, including ViewDescriptor.getView().<br>
<br>
ViewDescriptors are also responsible for registering all the child Views.  Normally this happens automatically based on the hierarchy defined in the XML document.  However, some components define their own children that need to be registered explicitly.  One example is the CCActionTable which delegates to its model to define its children.<br>
