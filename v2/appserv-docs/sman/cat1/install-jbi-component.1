DESCRIPTION

     or binding component into the JBI environment.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --enabled               If this option is set to  true,  the
                             component  is  started automatically
                             when the system starts up. Users are
                             allowed  to access the component. If
                             this option is  set  to  false,  the
                             component  is  not started automati-
                             cally when  the  system  starts  up.
                             Users  are  not  able  to access the
                             component.  For  EE,   this   option
                             enables  the component on the speci-
                             fied  target  instance  or  cluster.
                             This option is ignored when the com-
                             ponent is being deployed on the tar-
                             get domain.

     --properties            Property values that are to  be  set
                             for the component. The option can be
                             specified as a  string  of  keyword-
                             value  pairs,  or the name of a pro-
                             perty file can be provided.

     --upload                When this option is set to true, the
                             command  uploads  the  file  to  the

                             administration server. The  file  is
                             uploaded to the $JBI_HOME/tmp direc-
                             tory on  the  Domain  Administration
                             Server     (DAS),    for    example,
                             $AS_INSTALL_DIR/domains/domain_name/jbi/tmp.
                             If  the  filepath of the installable
                             file  is  mounted  to   the   server
                             machine,  or  if  the administration
                             server is running locally, set  this
                             option to false.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are  installing  the  JBI component.
                             Specify this option only if you  are
                             installing  the  JBI  component in a
                             multiserver environment with a  DAS.
                             If  you  are  not installing the JBI
                             component in a multiserver  environ-
                             ment  with  a  DAS,  this  option is
                             ignored. Valid values are:

                               o  server, which installs the  JBI
                                  component  on  the embedded DAS
                                  instance. This is  the  default
                                  value.

                               o  domain, which installs the  JBI
                                  component on the administrative
                                  domain itself.  Specify  domain
                                  only if you are using the clus-
                                  ter profile.

                               o  cluster_name,  which   installs
                                  the   JBI  component  on  every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name,  which  installs
                                  the  JBI component on the named
                                  unclustered server instance.

OPERANDS
     filepath or component_name

         The path to the archive file that  contains  the  attri-
         butes  of  the JBI component or the name of the JBI com-
         ponent or service  assembly  that  has  previously  been
         installed.
