EXC_CannotGetJDOImplHelper=A SecurityException was thrown when trying to get \
the singleton JDOImplHelper instance. In order to get runtime metadata, you \
must grant com.sun.persistence.support.spi.JDOPermission("getMetadata") to the \
codeBase containing the state manager implementation.
EXC_CannotSetStateManager=A SecurityException was thrown when calling \
jdoReplaceStateManager on persistence capable class instance. In order to set \
the state manager, you must grant \
com.sun.persistence.support.spi.JDOPermission("setStateManager") to the codeBase \
containing the state manager implementation and to the codeBase containing the \
class files of the persistent capable classes.
EXC_PersistentInAnotherPersistenceManager=Invalid attempt to make persistent an object that is owned by a different PersistenceManager.
EXC_NotNeededByRI=Method {0} is not needed in the reference implementation and should not have been invoked.
EXC_CannotAccessModel=Cannot access JDO Model for {0}.
EXC_SCONotCloneable=An instance of class {0} is of an SCO type but is not cloneable.

# Exceptions for SCO type validation:
EXC_WrongElementType=Element type of this tracked instance ({0}) is not assignable from type specified in the JDO Model ({1}).
EXC_WrongValueType=Value type of this tracked instance ({0}) is not assignable from type specified in the JDO Model ({1}).
EXC_WrongKeyType=Key type of this tracked instance ({0}) is not assignable from type specified in the JDO Model ({1}).

# NOI18N
EXC_NullLifeCycle=Internal error on replacingStateManager - LifeCycle is null.
# NOI18N
EXC_NotTransitionTransient=Internal error on replacingStateManager - not transitioning to transient.
# NOI18N
EXC_SameStateManager=Internal error on replacingStateManager - same StateManager.

#
# Lifecycle
#
EXC_DirtyInstance=Instance is dirty.
EXC_AccessDeletedField=Access to fields is not allowed for deleted instances.
# NOI18N
# In the following exception {0} is "commit" or "rollback", and {1} is Lifecycle state.
EXC_InconsistentState=Inconsistent state on {0}: {1}.
EXC_TransactionNotActive=Transaction is not active.
