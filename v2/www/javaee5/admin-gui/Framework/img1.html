<p><h3>Notes:</h3><br>
When developing a JATO application, it is natural to develop ViewBean base classes that provide common functionality.  Sharing code without base classes is clumsy and difficult to fit into the typical JATO environment.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, maintaining a hierarchy of ViewBeans and understanding the consequences of changing base-class code can be very confusing.  Often, for this reason, code is copied to many places with an application â€“ it is easier to copy the code you need (and perhaps change it slightly) than to figure out how to properly re-use it.  This makes maintenance difficult.  Also not all code that should be re-used should be in the base class, this leads to problems.<br>
<br>
The default implementation of JATO recognizes event code by introspecting a well known naming convention.  This is not always intuitive to developers and thanks to the hierarchy of View objects often present, it is not obvious what events are implemented.<br>
<br>
Lockhart in particular makes View object creation difficult.  The requirements for creating a component varies significantly.  Also, where to create certain objects is not always clear.  Many developers event create object in the constructor!  These issues make object creation slow and inconsistent.<br>
<br>
Lockhart applications are not toolable.  The Lockhart components are not compatible with JATO's components that are toolable.<br>
