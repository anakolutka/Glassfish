<a name="monitorresources"></a><h4>To Monitor Resources</h4><ol>
<li><b>Do one of the following:</b><ul>
<li><b>For the developer profile, in the tree component, select the Application Server node.
Click the Monitor tab.</b></li>
<li><b>For the cluster or enterprise profile In the tree component, select Common Tasks,
then click View Monitoring Data.</b></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Click the Resources tab.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the resource to monitor from the View list.</b><p>The page then displays monitoring data for the selected resource. For a description
of properties that can be monitored, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3671/ablur?a=view">Chapter 18, Monitoring Components and Services, in <i>Sun Java System Application Server 9.1 Administration Guide</i></a>.</p><p>If the resource you wish to monitor does not appear, click Configure Monitoring.</p><p>If no monitoring data is displayed for resources, it is most likely that the
resource does not exist or is not exercised. Resources monitoring data is available
only when the resources exist, monitoring is enabled for the resource at a
level of HIGH, and the resource is being exercised. For example, if you
have created a JDBC connector service, but applications that use that connector service
have not yet requested a connector from the service, that service has not
yet been created, therefore, no service exists and no monitoring data is available.
Once the JDBC application is executed and requests a connector from a service,
the service is registered in the monitoring registry and monitoring data appears.</p></li></ol>
