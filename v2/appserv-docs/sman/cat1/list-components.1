DESCRIPTION
     The command list-components lists all  deployed  Java  EE  5
     components.  If the --type option is not specified, all com-
     ponents are listed. The available type values are:  applica-
     tion  (default),  ejb,  web, connector and webservice.  This
     command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse      Indicates that any output data must be  very
                     concise,  typically  avoiding human-friendly
                     sentences and favoring  well-formatted  data
                     for  consumption  by  a  script.  Default is
                     false.

     -e --echo       Setting to true will echo the  command  line
                     statement on the standard output. Default is
                     false.

     -I --interactiveIf set to true (default), only the  required
                     password options are prompted.

     -H --host       The machine name where the  domain  adminis-
                     tration server is running. The default value
                     is localhost.

     -p --port       The HTTP/S port for administration. This  is
                     the  port  to  which  you  should point your
                     browser in order to manage the domain.   For
                     example, http://localhost:4848.

                     The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure     If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to  communicate
                     with the domain administration server.

     -u --user       The authorized domain administration  server
                     administrative username.

                     If you have authenticated to a domain  using
                     the asadmin login command, then you need not
                     specify  the  --user  option  on  subsequent
                     operations to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile  The --passwordfile option specifies the name
                     of a file containing the password entries in
                     a specific format. The entry for  the  pass-
                     word must have the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed
                     by the password name in uppercase letters.

                     For example, to specify the domain  adminis-
                     tration  server  password, use an entry with
                     the            following             format:
                     AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,  where  password
                     is the actual administrator password.  Other
                     passwords  that  can  be  specified  include
                     AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                     AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,                   and
                     AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                     All remote commands must specify  the  admin
                     password   to  authenticate  to  the  domain
                     administration  server,  either  through  --
                     passwordfile  or  asadmin login, or interac-
                     tively on the command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                     login  command  can  be used only to specify
                     the admin  password.  For  other  passwords,
                     that  must be specified for remote commands,
                     use the --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                     command prompt.

                     If you have authenticated to a domain  using
                     the asadmin login command, then you need not
                     specify the admin password  through  the  --
                     passwordfile option on subsequent operations
                     to this particular domain. However, this  is
                     applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option.
                     You will still need  to  provide  the  other
                     passwords,            for           example,
                     AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when  required
                     by  individual  commands,  such  as  update-

                     file-user.

                     For security reasons, passwords specified as
                     an  environment variable will not be read by
                     asadmin.

                     The        default         value         for
                     AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help          Displays the help text for the command.

     --type          This is the type of component to be  listed.
                     The  options are application, ejb, web, con-
                     nector and webservice. If nothing is  speci-
                     fied, then all of the components are listed.
