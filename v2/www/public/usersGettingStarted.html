<font size="+1"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Getting Started Guide</span></font>

<p>

Most GlassFish users are application developers who are primarily
interested in using it as a binary as opposed to work with its
source-code. This guide is intended to get Java EE developers up and
running by providing an example application and instructions about deploying and running on GlassFish.

</p>




<p>
Here are some simple steps for
deploying applications on GlassFish.&nbsp; The application chosen is a
sample of the new features in the Serlvet spec.&nbsp; GlassFish is an
implementation of the Java EE 5 specifications and has implemented the
features in JSR 154 today.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also deploy your
favorite J2EE 1.4 based application as Java EE is backward compatible.&nbsp; <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=56">Let
us know</a> how your application runs on GlassFish and if you run into
problems.<br>
</p>




<span style="font-weight: bold;">Download and configure GlassFish<br>
</span>
<p>We recommend that you use a <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/downloadsindex.html">promoted</a> build since those have passed at a set of Quicklook, CTS and functional tests.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; </span>Follow
the instructions on the download page to install and configure the
server.&nbsp; To start the server on the command line type<br>
&nbsp; &lt;glassfish-install&gt;/bin/asadmin start-domain<br>
</p>

<p>The default administration values are as follows:<br>
</p>

domain.name="domain1"<br>
instance.name="server"<br>
admin.user="admin"<br>
admin.password="adminadmin"<br>
admin.port="4848"<br>
instance.port"="8080"<br>
orb.port="3700"<br>
imq.port="7676"<br>
https.port="8181" 
<p><br>


</p>




<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Download&nbsp; examples&nbsp;</span> </p>



&nbsp;For your convience the servlet examples are provided as a war
file.&nbsp; If you would like to build them yourself you can <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/source./browse/servlet-api/src/jakarta-servletapi-5/jsr154">find the
code</a> in the GlassFish workspace.&nbsp; Simply<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/BuildGlassFish.html"> build the servlet-api
module</a> and the examples will be built also.&nbsp; These examples were selected because they demonstrate the
latest features in JSR 154, Servlet Specification.&nbsp; There is a
pointer to the source code which is available in the GlassFish
repository and the jakarta project on Apache.<br>



<br>

Save the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=3761">servlet example war file to your disk.</a><br>

<br>

<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=3761">
</a>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deploy the example application&nbsp;

<br>
<br>
</span>
For now the easiest way to deploy on GlassFish is to use the autodeploy
feature.&nbsp; We are working on plugins for both NetBeans and Eclipse.<br>
</p>


<p>You can simply copy the war file in the following directory &lt;glassfish-install&gt;/domains/domain1/autodeploy<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>and the<br>
server will automatically deploy the application.&nbsp; There is no need to restarted the server.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span> </p>





<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Test the application</span><br>



<br>



Go to the following URL to see the application running:<br>



<br>



http://localhost:8080/servlet24samples/<br>



<br>



Note: 8080 is the default port for the web server; if you installed on a different port you will need to that value here.<br>
