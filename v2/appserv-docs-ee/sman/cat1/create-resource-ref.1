NAME
     create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-ref   --user   admin_user    [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--target target] [--enabled=true] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-ref command creates a reference  from  a
     cluster  or  an  unclustered server instance to a previously
     created resource (for example, a JDBC resource created using
     the  create-jdbc-resource command). This effectively results
     in the resource being made available in the JNDI tree of the
     targeted instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they  will  receive
     the new resource the next time they start.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can

                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.

                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-

     --target                Specifies the target for  which  you
                             are creating the resource reference.
                             Valid targets are

                               o  server,   which   creates   the
                                  resource   reference   for  the
                                  default server  instance.  This
                                  is the default target.

                               o  cluster_name, which creates the
                                  resource  reference  for  every
                                  server instance in the cluster

                               o  instance_name,  which   creates
                                  the  resource reference for the

                                  instance

                             take effect only if the resource  is
                             enabled  at  the  global  level. The
                             default is true.
