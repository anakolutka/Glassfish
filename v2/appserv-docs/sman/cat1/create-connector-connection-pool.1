OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                The target option is deprecated.

     --raname                The name of the resource adapter.

     --connectiondefinition  The name of the  connection  defini-
                             tion.

     --steadypoolsize        The minimum and  initial  number  of
                             connections  maintained in the pool.
                             The default value is 8.

     --maxpoolsize           The maximum  number  of  connections
                             that   can  be  created  to  satisfy
                             client requests. The  default  value
                             is 32.

     --maxwaittime           The amount of time, in milliseconds,
                             that  a  caller  must  wait before a
                             connection is created, if a  connec-
                             tion  is not available. If set to 0,
                             the caller is  blocked  indefinitely
                             until  a  resource  is  available or
                             until an error occurs.  The  default
                             value is 60000.

     --poolresize            The number of connections to be des-
                             troyed  if  the  existing  number of
                             connections  is  above  the  steady-
                             pool-size   (subject  to  the  limit
                             specified   in    the    maxpoolsize
                             option).  Possible values are from 0
                             to MAX_INTEGER.  The  default  value
                             is 2.

     --idletimeout           The maximum time that  a  connection
                             can  remain  idle in the pool. After
                             this amount of time,  the  pool  can
                             close  this  connection. The default
                             value is 300.

     --failconnection        If set to true, all  connections  in
                             the  pool  are  closed  if  a single
                             validation check fails. This parame-
                             ter   is   mandatory   if   the  is-
                             connection-validation-required    is
                             set  to  true.  Legal values are on,
                             off, yes, no, 1,0,  true  or  false.
                             The default value is false.

     --transactionsupport    Indicates the level  of  transaction
                             support  that  this  pool will have.
                             Possible values  are  XATransaction,
                             LocalTransaction  and NoTransaction.
                             This  attribute  can  have  a  value
                             lower  than  or  equal  to  but  not
                             higher than the  resource  adapter's
                             transaction  support  attribute. The
                             resource adapter's transaction  sup-
                             port   attribute  has  an  order  of
                             values, where XATransaction  is  the

                             highest,   and   NoTransaction   the
                             lowest.

     --isconnectvalidatereq  If the value is  set  to  true,  the
                             connections  will  be checked to see
                             if they are usable, before they  are
                             given  out  to  the application. The
                             default value is false.

     --description           Text providing  descriptive  details
                             about the connector connection pool.

     --property              Optional attribute name value  pairs
                             for configuring the resource.
