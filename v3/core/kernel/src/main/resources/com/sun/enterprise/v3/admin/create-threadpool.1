NAME
     create-threadpool - adds a threadpool

SYNOPSIS
     create-threadpool
     [--help]
      [ --target  target_name]
      [--maxthreadpoolsize max_thread_pool_size]
      [--minthreadpoolsize min_thread_pool_size]
      [--idletimeout idle_thread_timeout_in_seconds]
      [--workqueues number_work_queues] threadpool_id

DESCRIPTION
     The create-threadpool command creates a threadpool with  the
     specified  name.  You can specify maximum and minimum number
     of threads in the pool, the number of work queues,  and  the
     idle  timeout  of  a  thread. The created thread pool can be
     used for servicing IIOP requests and for  resource  adapters
     to  service  work  management  requests.  Please note that a
     created  thread  pool  can  be  used  in  multiple  resource
     adapters. This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --maxthreadpoolsize

         Maximum number of threads in  the  threadpool  servicing
         requests  in  this queue. This is the upper bound on the
         number of threads that exist in the threadpool.

     --minthreadpoolsize
         Minimum number of threads in  the  threadpool  servicing
         requests  in this queue. These are created up front when
         the threadpool is instantiated.

     --idletimeout

         Idle threads are removed from the pool after this time.
