[A] Changes that were made to build packager-ext from glassfish.root/glassfish

1. Changes in the bootstrap/make/bootstrap.properties ( diff in the same directory) . Note that we might have change some staging locations , and I had to change the repo values to workaround. I will fix this later.

2. Addition of targets and conditions and properties
2.1 Targets that have been added :

packages/common.xml
create-debian : Hook in the script to create debian packages here.

packages/SUNWxxx/build.xml
init-debian : This target is on the depends list of the create-debian and can be used for any initializing activity before creating a debian package.

2.2 conditions that have been added 

packager-ext/publish.xml 
A condition has been added to check if a debian package needs to be built or not.

2.3 Properties added 

packager-ext/package.properties
native.build=true  // added to indicate that we need a native package built
build.debian=false // new property introduced to indicate that a .deb package is to be built
javadoc.publish.home=${glassfish.root}/publish/javadocs // to indicate where the javadocs are published.

******************************************************************************************************
[B] How to build :
1. Apply diffs to bootstrap/make .
2. Drop the packager-ext module into glassfish.home ( <install-dir>/glassfish )
3. maven bootstrap
4. maven package
This should produce the zips for you in 
<install-dir>/publish/packages/JDK1.5_DBG.OBJ/installer/internal/classes/com/sun/enterprise/installer/windows/package

The native packages should be under ( rpms)
<install-dir>/glassfish/publish/HOST_OBJ/rpms

If you wish to turn of native package generation 
set the property native.build=false in packager-ext/package.properties
