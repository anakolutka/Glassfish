DESCRIPTION
     The list-clusters command lists the existing clusters.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

                             mand.

OPERANDS
     target                  Specifies the target for  which  the
                             clusters  are  to  be  listed. Valid
                             values are:

                               o  domain, which lists  all  clus-
                                  ters  in  the domain and is the
                                  default value

                               o  cluster_name, which  lists  the
                                  named cluster



                               o  instance_name, which lists  the
                                  cluster   associated  with  the
                                  clustered   server    instance.
                                  Unlike  many  of the other uses
                                  of instance_name, this  is  one
                                  situation  where an unclustered
                                  instance cannot be specified.

                               o  node_agent_name,  which   lists
                                  all  clusters  associated  with
                                  the named node agent. For exam-
                                  ple,  if agent1 manages server1
                                  and server2, which are part  of
                                  cluster1   and  cluster2,  then
                                  cluster1 and cluster2  will  be
                                  listed.
