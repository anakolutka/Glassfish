"Because CDI is so new, there's not yet a lot of information available "
"online. That will change over time. Regardless, the CDI specification "
"remains the authority for information on CDI. The spec is less than 100 "
"pages and is quite readable (don't worry, it's not like your Blu-ray player "
"manual). Of course, it covers many details we've skipped over here. The spec"
" is available on the <ulink "
"url=\"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299\">JSR-299 page</ulink> at the JCP "
"website."

"development team and the CDI spec lead blog at <ulink "
"url=\"http://in.relation.to\">in.relation.to</ulink>. This guide was "
"originally based on a series of blog entries published there while the "
"specification was being developed. It's probably the best source of "
"information about the future of CDI, Weld and Seam."
