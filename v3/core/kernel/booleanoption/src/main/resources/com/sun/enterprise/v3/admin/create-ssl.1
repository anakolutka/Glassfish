DESCRIPTION
     Creates and configures the SSL element in the selected  HTTP
     listener,  IIOP  listener,  or IIOP service to enable secure
     communication on that listener/service.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user

         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile
         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is
         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, passwords specified as an environ-
         ment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created
         with the cluster profile  or  the  enterprise  profile..
         Specifies  the  target  on which you are configuring the
         ssl element. The following values are valid:

         server

             Specifies the server in which  the  iiop-service  or
             HTTP/IIOP listener is to be configured for SSL.

         config
             Specifies  the  configuration  that   contains   the
             HTTP/IIOP  listener or iiop-service for which SSL is
             to be configured.

         cluster

             Specifies  the  cluster  in  which   the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service  is  to be configured for
             SSL. All the server instances in  the  cluster  will
             get   the   SSL  configuration  for  the  respective
             listener or iiop-service.

         instance
             Specifies  the  instance  in  which  the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service  is  to be configured for
             SSL.

Administration Commands                             create-ssl(1)

     --type

         The type of service or listener for  which  the  SSL  is
         created. The type can be:

             o    http-listener

             o    iiop-listener

             o    iiop-service
         When the type  is  iiop-service,  the  ssl-client-config
         along  with  the  embedded  ssl  element  is  created in
         domain.xml.

     --certname
         The nickname of the server certificate in  the  certifi-
         cate  database  or  the PKCS#11 token. The format of the
         name in the certificate is tokenname:nickname. For  this
         property, the tokenname: is optional.

     --ssl2enabled

         Set this property to true to enable  SSL2.  The  default
         value  is false. If both SSL2 and SSL3 are enabled for a
         virtual server, the server tries SSL3 encryption  first.
         In  the  event  SSL3  encryption  fails, the server then
         tries SSL2 encryption.

     --ssl2ciphers
         A comma-separated list of the SSL2 ciphers to  be  used.
         Use  the prefix + to enable or - to disable a particular
         cipher. Allowed values are:

             o    rc4

             o    rc4export

             o    rc2

             o    rc2export

             o    idea

             o    des

             o    desede3
         If no value is  specified,  all  supported  ciphers  are
         assumed to be enabled.

     --ssl3enabled

         Set this property to false to disable SSL3. The  default
         value  is  true. If both SSL2 and SSL3 are enabled for a
         virtual server, the server tries SSL3 encryption  first.
         In  the  event  SSL3  encryption  fails, the server then
         tries SSL2 encryption.

     --tlsenabled
         Set this property to false to disable TLS.  The  default
         value  is  true It is good practice to enable TLS, which
         is a more secure version of SSL.

     --ssl3tlsciphers

         A comma-separated list of the SSL3 and/or TLS ciphers to
         be  used.  Use  the prefix + to enable or - to disable a
         particular cipher. Allowed values are:

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA

             o    SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA
         If no value is  specified,  all  supported  ciphers  are
         assumed to be enabled.

     --tlsrollbackenabled
         Set to true (default) to enable TLS rollback. TLS  roll-
         back  should  be enabled for Microsoft Internet Explorer
         5.0  and  5.5.  This   option   is   only   valid   when
         -tlsenabled=true.

     --clientauthenabled

         Set to true if you want  SSL3 client authentication per-
         formed  on every request independent of ACL-based access
         control. Default value is false.
