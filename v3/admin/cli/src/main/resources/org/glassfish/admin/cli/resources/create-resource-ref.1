Administration Commands                    create-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-ref
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target]
     [--enabled=true] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-ref command creates a reference  from  a
     cluster  or  an  unclustered server instance to a previously
     created resource (for example, a JDBC resource created using
     the  create-jdbc-resource command). This effectively results
     in the resource being made available in the JNDI tree of the
     targeted instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they  will  receive
     the new resource the next time they start.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server

Administration Commands                    create-resource-ref(1)

         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:8080/admin.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile
         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

Administration Commands                    create-resource-ref(1)

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Specifies the target for  which  you  are  creating  the
         resource reference. Valid targets are

         server

             Creates  the  resource  reference  for  the  default
             server instance. This is the default target.

         cluster_name
             Creates the  resource  reference  for  every  server
             instance in the cluster.

         instance_name

             Creates  the  resource  reference  for   the   named
             unclustered server instance.

         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created

     --enabled

         Indicates whether the resource should be  enabled.  This
         value  will  take effect only if the resource is enabled
         at the global level. The default is true.

OPERANDS
     reference_name              The name or  JNDI  name  of  the
                                 resource.
