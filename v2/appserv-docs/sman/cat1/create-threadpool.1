DESCRIPTION
     The create-threadpool command creates a threadpool with  the
     specified  name.  You can specify maximum and minimum number
     of threads in the pool, the number of work queues,  and  the
     idle  timeout  of  a thread.  The created thread pool can be
     used for servicing IIOP requests and for  resource  adapters
     to  service  work  management  requests.  Please note that a
     created  thread  pool  can  be  used  in  multiple  resource
     adapters. This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should

                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For

                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                This option specifies the target  on
                             which  you  are creating the thread-
                             pool. Valid values are

                               o  server,   which   creates   the
                                  threadpool   for   the  default
                                  server instance server  and  is
                                  the default value

                               o  configuration_name,       which
                                  creates  the threadpool for the
                                  named configuration

                               o  cluster_name, which creates the
                                  threadpool   for  every  server
                                  instance in the cluster

                               o  instance_name,  which   creates
                                  the threadpool for a particular

                                  server instance

     --maxthreadpoolsize     Maximum number  of  threads  in  the
                             threadpool   servicing  requests  in
                             this queue.  This is the upper bound
                             on  the number of threads that exist
                             in the threadpool.

     --minthreadpoolsize     Minimum number  of  threads  in  the
                             threadpool   servicing  requests  in
                             this queue.  These  are  created  up
                             front when the threadpool is instan-
                             tiated.

     --idletimeout           Idle threads are  removed  from  the
                             pool after this time.

     --workqueues            Identifies the total number of  work
                             queues serviced by this threadpool.

OPERANDS
     threadpool_id           an ID for the work queue; for  exam-
                             ple,  thread-pool-1,  thread-pool-2,
                             etc.
