User Commands                                        multimode(1)

NAME
     multimode - allows you to execute  multiple  commands  while
     preserving environment settings and remaining in the asadmin
     utility

SYNOPSIS
     multimode [--file filename] [--printprompt=true] [--encoding
     encode] [--terse=false] [--echo=false]

DESCRIPTION
     Use multimode to process the asadmin commands. The  command-
     line  interface  will prompt you for a command, execute that
     command, display the results of the command, and then prompt
     you  for  the  next  command.  Additionally, all the asadmin
     option names set in this mode are used for  all  the  subse-
     quent  commands.  You  can set your environment and run com-
     mands until you exit multimode by typing "exit"  or  "quit."
     You  can  also  provide  commands  by  passing  a previously
     prepared list of commands from  a  file  or  standard  input
     (pipe).  You  can  invoke  multimode from within a multimode
     session; once you exit the second multimode environment, you
     return to your original multimode environment.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --file                  reads the commands as defined in the
                             file.

     --printprompt           allows  the  printing   of   asadmin
                             prompt  after  each  command is exe-
                             cuted. Set this option to false when
                             the commands are piped or redirected
                             from the standard input or file.  By
                             default the option is set to true.

     --encoding              specifies the locale for the file to
                             be decoded.

     --terse                 indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     --echo                  setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on to the stan-
                             dard output. Default is false.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using multimode to execute multiple commands

     are executed from the commands_file.txt file.

EXIT STATUS
