DESCRIPTION
     Use the configure-http-lb-config command to  create  a  load
     balancer  configuration, enable all servers and applications
     for a target (for example, a cluster), set the load balancer
     policy, and generate and export the load balancer configura-
     tion file.

     After using this command to create the load balancer  confi-
     guration,  you can create the physical load balancer by run-
     ning create-http-lb, and enable  automatic  updates  to  the
     physical  load balancer when the load balancer configuration
     changes. Or, you can use this command  to  create  the  load
     balancer  configuration, export it to an XML file, and manu-
     ally copy it to the web server.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify

                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --responsetimeout       The time in seconds within  which  a
                             server   instance   must   return  a
                             response. If no response is received
                             within  the  time period, the server
                             is considered unhealthy. If set to a
                             positive  number, and the request is
                             idempotent, the request is  retried.
                             If the request is not idempotent, an
                             error page is returned. If set to  0
                             no  timeout  is used. The default is
                             60.

     --httpsrouting          If set to true,  HTTPS  requests  to
                             the  load  balancer  result in HTTPS
                             requests to the server instance.  If
                             set  to false, HTTPS requests to the
                             load   balancer   result   in   HTTP
                             requests to the server instance. The
                             default is false.

     --reloadinterval        The  interval  between  checks   for
                             changes  to the load balancer confi-
                             guration file loadbalancer.xml. When
                             the  check detects changes, the con-
                             figuration file is reloaded. A value
                             of 0 disables reloading.

     --monitor               Specifies  whether   monitoring   is
                             enabled. The default is false.

     --routecookie           This option is deprecated. The value
                             is always true.

     --healthcheckerurl      The URL to ping to determine whether
                             the instance is healthy.

     --healthcheckerinterval The interval in seconds  the  health
                             checker  waits  between checks of an
                             unhealthy instance to see whether it
                             has   become  healthy.  The  default
                             value is 30 seconds. A  value  of  0
                             disables the health checker.

     --healthcheckertimeout  The interval in seconds  the  health
                             checker  waits to receive a response
                             from  an  instance.  If  the  health
                             checker  has not received a response
                             in this interval,  the  instance  is
                             considered unhealthy.

     ---target               Specifies the target  to  which  the
                             load balancer configuration applies.

                             Valid values are:

                               o  cluster_name,  which  specifies
                                  that  requests for this cluster
                                  will be  handled  by  the  load
                                  balancer.

                               o  stand-alone_instance_name,
                                  which  specifies  that requests
                                  for this  stand-alone  instance
                                  will  be  handled  by  the load
                                  balancer.

     --lbxmlfile             The name of the XML file  to  export
                             the  load balancer configuration to.
                             If you do not specify  a  name,  the
                             file  is not exported. If you do not
                             specify a path, the file is exported
                             to the current directory.

     --lbpolicy              The policy the load balancer follows
                             to  distribute  load  to  the server
                             instances in a cluster. Valid values
                             are   round-robin,   weighted-round-
                             robin,  and  user-defined.  If   you
                             choose  user-defined, specify a load

                             balancer  policy  module  with   the
                             lbpolicymodule option. If you choose
                             weighted-round-robin assign  weights
                             to  the  server  instances using the
                             configure-lb-weight   command.   The
                             default is round-robin.

     --lbpolicymodule        If your target is a cluster and  the
                             load   balancer   policy   is  user-
                             defined, use this option to  specify
                             the full path and name of the shared
                             library of your load balancing  pol-
                             icy module. The shared library needs
                             to be in a  location  accessible  by
                             the web server.

OPERANDS
     config_name             The name of the  new  load  balancer
                             configuration.  This  name  must not
                             conflict   with   any   other   load
                             balancer  groups, agents, configura-
                             tions, clusters, or sever  instances
                             in the domain.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the configure-http-lb-config command

     The  following  command  creates  a   configuration   called
     mylbconfig for the target cluster mycluster. It configures a
     health checker, sets the load balancer  policy  to  weighted
     round  robin, and exports the configuration to a file called
     loadbalancer.xml in the /config directory.

     asadmin> configure-http-lb-config --user admin --passwordfile file
     --healthcheckerurl / --healthcheckerinterval 40 --healthcheckertimeout 30
     --target mycluster --lbxmlfile /config/loadbalancer.xml --lbpolicy
     weighted-round-robin mylbconfig
     Command configure-http-lb-config executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
