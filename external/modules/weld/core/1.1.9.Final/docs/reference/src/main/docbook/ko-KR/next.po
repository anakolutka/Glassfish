"Because CDI is so new, there's not yet a lot of information available "
"online. That will change over time. Regardless, the CDI specification "
"remains the authority for information on CDI. The spec is less than 100 "
"pages and is quite readable (don't worry, it's not like your Blu-ray player "
"manual). Of course, it covers many details we've skipped over here. The spec"
" is available on the <ulink "
"url=\"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=299\">JSR-299 page</ulink> at the JCP "
"website."
