DESCRIPTION
     Creates the lifecycle module. The lifecycle modules  provide
     a  means  of running short or long duration Java-based tasks
     within the application server environment. This  command  is
     supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --classname             This is the fully qualified name  of
                             the startup class.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should

                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For

                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                Indicates  the  location  where  the
                             lifecycle  is  to  be  created.  The
                             valid targets for this  command  are
                             configuration,   instance,  cluster,
                             and server. The default is server.

     --classpath             This  option  indicates  where  this
                             module  is actually located if it is
                             not under applications-root.

     --loadorder             This option  represents  an  integer
                             value  that can be used to force the
                             order in  which  deployed  lifecycle
                             modules   are   loaded   at   server

                             startup.  Smaller  numbered  modules
                             get loaded sooner. Order is unspeci-
                             fied  if  two  or   more   lifecycle
                             modules  have  the  same  load-order
                             value.

     --failurefatal          This options tells the  system  what
                             to  do  if the lifecycle module does
                             not load correctly. When this option
                             is  set  to  true, the system aborts
                             the server startup  if  this  module
                             does  not load properly. The default
                             value is false.

     --enabled               This option determines  whether  the
                             resource  is enabled at runtime. The
                             default values is true.

     --description           This is the text description of  the
                             resource    associated   with   this
                             module.

     --property              This is an optional  attribute  con-
                             taining  name/value  pairs  used  to
                             configure the resource.

OPERANDS
     module_name             This operand is a unique  identifier
                             for  the  deployed  server lifecycle
                             event listener module.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: using create-lifecycle-module

     asadmin> create-lifecycle-module --user admin --passwordfile adminpassword.txt

     --description "this is a sample customSetup"
     --property rmi="Server=acme1:7070":timeout=30 customSetup
     Command create-lifecycle-module executed successfully

     Where: customSetup is the  lifecycle  module  created.   The
     escape  character  is used in the property option to distin-
     guish the colons (:).
