<a name="jbilifecycle"></a><h3>Lifecycle States Within the JBI Environment</h3>
<a name="indexterm-39"></a><a name="indexterm-40"></a><a name="indexterm-41"></a><p>Service Assemblies and Components have lifecycle states that can be managed using the
Application Server Admin Console. The lifecycle states of Service Units are managed indirectly
through the Service Assembly.</p><p>JBI components and Service Assemblies have the following lifecyle states:</p>
<ul><li><p> Started</p><p>The component or Service Assembly has been successfully started.</p></li>
<li><p> Stopped</p><p>The component or Service Assembly has been stopped (which implies it was previously started).  See the component documentation for the use of this state.</p></li>
<li><p>Shutdown</p><p>The component or Service Assembly has been shut down. In this state, the component can be uninstalled and the Service Assembly can be undeployed.</p></li></ul>
<p>The JBI Runtime persists the lifecycle states of JBI components and Service Assemblies.
When the application server shuts down and then restarts, JBI components and Service
Assemblies revert to their state at the time the application server shut down.
</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>The JBI runtime attempts to revert to the "desired" state of a JBI
component or a Service Assembly. For example, suppose you tried to start a
JBI component but it did not start due to an error in the
component. If you restart the Application Server, the JBI runtime attempts to start
the component again.</p>
