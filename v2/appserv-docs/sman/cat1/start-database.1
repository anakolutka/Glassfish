User Commands                                   start-database(1)

NAME
     start-database - starts the Java DB

SYNOPSIS
     start-database [--dbhost 0.0.0.0] [--dbport 1527]  [--dbhome
     DERBY_INSTALL] [--echo=false] [--terse=false]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-database command starts the Java DB server that is
     available  with  the  Sun  Java  System  Application  Server
     software for use with the Application Server. Use this  com-
     mand  only  for  working  with  applications deployed to the
     Application Server. Java DB is based upon Apache Derby.

     When the Java DB database server is started using this  com-
     mand, the database server is started in Network Server mode.
     Clients connecting to it must use the Java DB  ClientDriver.
     For  details  on  connecting  to  the  database, such as the
     Driver Class Name and Connection URL, please see the  Apache
     Derby documentation.

     When the database server starts, or a client connects to  it
     successfully, two types of files are created:

       o  The derby.log file that contains  the  database  server
          process log along with its standard output and standard
          error information.

       o  The database files that contain your schema (for  exam-
          ple, database tables).

     Both types of files are created at the location specified by
     the  dbhome  option.  When  -dbhome  is  not  specified, the
     default is the value of  DERBY_INSTALL,  which  defaults  to
     install-dir/javadb. It is important to use the dbhome option
     when you want to create the database files at  a  particular
     location.  The  start-database  command  starts the database
     process, even if it cannot write to the log file.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --dbhost                The host name or IP address  of  the
                             Java DB server process.  The default
                             is the  IP  address  0.0.0.0,  which
                             denotes  all  network  interfaces on
                             the host where you  run  the  start-
                             database command.

     --dbport                The port number where  the  Java  DB
                             server  listens  for  client connec-
                             tions. This port must  be  available
                             for the listen socket, otherwise the
                             database server will not start.  The
                             default is 1527.

     --dbhome                The absolute path to  the  directory
                             where  Java  DB  and  the  derby.log
                             files are created.  The  default  is
                             DERBY_INSTALL.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -t --terse              Setting to false  displays  detailed
                             database   information.  Default  is
                             false.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the start-database command

     The following command starts Java DB on the host  host1  and
     port 5001:

     asadmin> start-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001 --terse=true
     Starting database in the background.  Log redirected to /opt/SUNWappserver/javdb/derby.log.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status applies to errors in executing  the  asadmin
     command.   For  information  on  database  errors,  see  the
     derby.log file.

     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
