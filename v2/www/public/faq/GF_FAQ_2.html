<p><b><b>Q:<b><b><a name="What_is"></a> What is Project GlassFish?</b></b></b></b></p>



<p><b><b><b>GlassFish is the name for the open source development
project
for
building a Java EE 5 application server. It is based on the source code
for Sun Java System Application Server PE 9 donated by Sun Microsystems
and TopLink persistence code donated by Oracle. This project provides a
structured
process for developing a high quality application server that makes new
features available faster than ever before. It is the response to Java
developers who want access to the source code and the ability to
contribute to the development of Sun's next generation application
server which is based on GlassFish. This project is designed to
encourage communication between Sun
and Oracle engineers and the community and will enable all developers
to
participate in the application server development process.
</b></b></b></p>
<br>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="available"></a>What is available on the
website?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Nightly builds and the source code for the application
server
are available on <a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net">http://glassfish.dev.java.net</a>.
As with other community development sites, you will also find email
lists, discussion forums, news, feedback, licensing information, and
extensive help resources.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="community"></a>How large is the GlassFish
community?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>The GlassFish development community is just getting started
so
it is
small but rapidly growing. There are over 100 contributors already
signed up. The number of Sun and Oracle engineers working on this
product is
comparable in size to other application server developer communities
today. With the release of project GlassFish to the community, we
expect to greatly increase the number of developers working on the code.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="access"></a>Where to I go to access the
GlassFish project?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net">http://glassfish.dev.java.net</a></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="changes"></a>Can I as a developer make any
changes I want to the code?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Yes, developers have free access to the source code under
the
terms
of the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) v1.0 and are
free
to change it as they see fit. To be able to claim Java Compatibility,
developers of commercial distributions will need to sign the Java
Developer License (JDL) and verify the code passes the compatibility
test suite (CTS) before they can redistribute it. Anyone can sign a
contribution agreement and
work on the code to contribute changes, bug fixes, and features.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="update"></a> How often can I get an update
of
GlassFish?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Updated builds for GlassFish will be posted every night to
glassfish.dev.java.net. These code pushes have gone through very basic
testing to ensure they will build and execute but have not been tested
as thoroughly as our production releases. Additionally, you have read
access to the same CVS tree that the developers do - so you always see
the latest versions of the code there. Occasionally, typically weekly
or so, we will push a "promoted" build which has been more thoroughly
tested and will contain many more documented features than the regular
nightly builds.&nbsp; A supported Beta and FCS version of the Sun Java
System Application Server 9.0 which is built on GlassFish.<br>
</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="version"></a> What version of Java EE does
this apply to?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>GlassFish will implement the latest version
of the Java EE platform, Java EE 5, and the two should become final at
around
the same time.&nbsp; At that time Sun will also release a final,
supported and compatible Sun Java System Application Server PE 9.0
based
on GlassFish.<br>
</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="release"></a>What is being released and
when?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>In June of 2005, Sun published project GlassFish by making
the
web
site available to the public. Developers can access source code,
nightly builds, discussion groups, and mailing lists. This is the first
time
developers were able to see and participate in the Application Server
development process. Over the next 6 months, Sun will gradually
roll out more information and more details about the code. Initially,
access will be provided to the web-tier followed by other modules as
GlassFish is developed.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="licensees"></a>How does this impact Java EE
licensees?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Project GlassFish opens up Java EE to a larger audience
that
will
ultimately be the customers of the Java EE licensees. GlassFish does
not change any of the license terms for licensees. Under their
license terms, licensees can still sell or distribute code and use the
Java Compatibility brand for products which have passed the TCK. Under
the license terms of the CDDL, which is granted to developers, they can
use, edit, and alter the code, and distribute it or use it in
production. However they do not have a license to use the CTS nor can
they use the Java Compatibility brand.
</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="terms"></a>What are the licensing terms?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>The OSI-approved CDDL license is being used for project
GlassFish
which allows developers to view, use, edit, and alter the code, and
distribute it or use it in production. Portions of this code are not
yet available in source form. Because of this, a few portions are
currently also under a Binary Distribution License. As time goes on,
we'll make more of the code available, with the eventual goal of making
all the code available, and removing the Binary Distribution license.
This isn't some sort of evil plot - it's hard work moving stuff out
into an Open environment, we expect to have a roadmap for our timing
for this published by the end of the Summer.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>People who want to redistribute a build of our application
server do
not have a license to use the CTS nor can they use the Java
Compatibility brand. They may choose to sign a JDL commercial license
and pass the CTS which would then allow them to distribute the code and
use the Java Compatibility brand.<br>
<b><br>
Q: <a name="CDDL"></a>I am a current SCSL licensee, and want to use
the CDDL. Can I do this?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Yes. Current SCSL licensees can choose to use the CDDL, but
they
must click through the new license, and use the CDDL notification in
their work.</b></b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><b><b><b>Q: <a name="cddlinfo"></a>Where
can I get more information about the CDDL license?<br>
</b></b></b></span></p>
<p><b><b><b>You can find details about the CDDL <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_why_details.html">here</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: <a name="cts"></a>Will there be compatibility tests for the Java
EE 5 platform?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>Yes. The Java EE 5 Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) will be
available
for the
Java EE 5 platform. The current J2EE CTS contains over 5,000 tests for
J2EE 1.4
and will contain more for Java EE 5 and beyond. This suite tests
compatibility by performing specific application functions and
checking results. For example, to test the JDBC call to insert a row
in a database, an EJB component makes a call to insert a row and then
a call is made to check that the row was inserted. In addition to the
tests themselves, passing the full suite requires adhering to a
specific set of rules. These rules are just as important, and in many
cases more important, than the content of the tests themselves.</b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Q: <a name="difference"></a>What is the difference
between
being a Java EE licensee and
being Java EE compatible?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>A Java EE licensee has signed a commercial distribution
license for
Java EE. That means the licensee has access to the compatibility tests
and has
made a commitment to maintain compatibility. It does not mean the
licensee's
products are necessarily compatible. Look for the Java EE brand
which signifies that the specific branded product has passed the
Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) and is compatible.</b></b></b></p>
