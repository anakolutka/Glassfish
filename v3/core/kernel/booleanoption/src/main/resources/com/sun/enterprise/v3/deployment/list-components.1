DESCRIPTION
     The command list-components lists all  deployed  Java  EE  5
     components.  If the --type option is not specified, all com-
     ponents are listed. The available type values are:  applica-
     tion  (default),  ejb,  web,  connector and webservice. This
     command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse          Indicates that any output data  must  be
                         very  concise, typically avoiding human-
                         friendly sentences  and  favoring  well-
                         formatted  data  for  consumption  by  a
                         script. Default is false.

     -e --echo           Setting to true will  echo  the  command
                         line  statement  on the standard output.
                         Default is false.

     -I --interactive    If  set  to  true  (default),  only  the
                         required password options are prompted.

     -H --host           The  machine  name  where   the   domain
                         administration  server  is  running. The
                         default value is localhost.

     -p --port           The HTTP/S port for administration. This
                         is  the  port  to which you should point
                         your browser  in  order  to  manage  the
                         domain.           For           example,
                         http://localhost:4848.

                         The default port number is 4848.

Administration Commands                        list-components(1)

     -s --secure         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to communi-
                         cate   with  the  domain  administration
                         server.

     -u --user           The  authorized  domain   administration
                         server administrative username.

                         If you have authenticated  to  a  domain
                         using  the  asadmin  login command, then
                         you need not specify the  --user  option
                         on subsequent operations to this partic-
                         ular domain.

     --passwordfile      The --passwordfile option specifies  the
                         name, including the full path, of a file
                         containing the  password  entries  in  a
                         specific format. The entry for the pass-
                         word must have the AS_ADMIN_ prefix fol-
                         lowed  by the password name in uppercase
                         letters.

                         For  example,  to  specify  the   domain
                         administration  server  password, use an
                         entry   with   the   following   format:
                         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,  where pass-
                         word is the actual  administrator  pass-
                         word. Other passwords that can be speci-
                         fied  include   AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,               and
                         AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                         All remote  commands  must  specify  the
                         admin  password  to  authenticate to the
                         domain  administration  server,   either
                         through --passwordfile or asadmin login,
                         or interactively on the command  prompt.
                         The  asadmin  login  command can be used
                         only to specify the admin password.  For
                         other  passwords, that must be specified
                         for  remote   commands,   use   the   --
                         passwordfile  or  enter them at the com-
                         mand prompt.

                         If you have authenticated  to  a  domain
                         using  the  asadmin  login command, then
                         you need not specify the admin  password
                         through  the  --passwordfile  option  on
                         subsequent operations to this particular
                         domain. However, this is applicable only
                         to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will

                         still  need  to  provide the other pass-
                         words,           for            example,
                         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,   as   and   when
                         required by individual commands, such as
                         update-file-user.

                         For security reasons,  passwords  speci-
                         fied as an environment variable will not
                         be read by asadmin.

                         The       default       value        for
                         AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help              Displays the help text for the command.

     --type              This is the  type  of  component  to  be
                         listed.  The  options  are  application,
                         ejb, web, connector and  webservice.  If
                         nothing  is  specified,  then all of the
                         components are listed.

OPERANDS
     -target             This is the  name  of  the  target  upon

                         values are:

                                  instance  server  and  is   the
                                  default value

                             o    domain_name,  which  lists  the
                                  components for the named domain

                                  components   for  every  server
                                  instance in the cluster
