NAME
     start-database - starts the Java DB

SYNOPSIS
     start-database  [--dbhost 0.0.0.0] [--dbport 1527]
     [--dbhome DERBY_INSTALL] [--echo=false]
     [--terse=false]

DESCRIPTION
     The start-database command starts the Java DB server that is
     available  with  the  Sun  Java  System  Application  Server
     software for use with the Application Server. Use this  com-
     mand  only  for  working  with  applications deployed to the
     Application Server. Java DB is based upon Apache Derby.

     When the Java DB database server is started using this  com-
     mand, the database server is started in Network Server mode.
     Clients connecting to it must use the Java DB  ClientDriver.
     For  details  on  connecting  to  the  database, such as the
     Driver Class Name and Connection URL, see the  Apache  Derby
     documentation.

     When the database server starts, or a client connects to  it
     successfully, two types of files are created:

         o    The  derby.log  file  that  contains  the  database
              server  process  log along with its standard output
              and standard error information.

         o    The database files that contain  your  schema  (for
              example, database tables).

     Both types of files are created at the location specified by
     the  --dbhome  option.  When  --dbhome is not specified, the
     default is the value of  DERBY_INSTALL,  which  defaults  to
     install-dir/javadb.  It  is  important  to  use the --dbhome
     option when you want to create the database files at a  par-
     ticular  location.  The  start-database  command  starts the
     database process, even if it cannot write to the log file.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --dbhost

         The host name or IP address of the Java DB  server  pro-
         cess.  The  default  is  the  IP  address 0.0.0.0, which
         denotes all network interfaces on the host where you run

Administration Commands                         start-database(1)

         the start-database command.

     --dbport

         The port number where the Java  DB  server  listens  for
         client  connections. This port must be available for the
         listen socket, otherwise the database  server  will  not
         start. The default is 1527.

     --dbhome
         The absolute path to the directory where Java DB and the
         derby.log    files   are   created.   The   default   is
         DERBY_INSTALL.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -t --terse
         Setting to false displays detailed database information.
         Default is false.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the start-database command

     The following command starts Java DB on the host  host1  and
     port 5001:

       asadmin> start-database --dbhost host1 --dbport 5001 --terse=true
       Starting database in the background.  Log redirected to
       /opt/SUNWappserver/javdb/derby.log.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status applies to errors in executing  the  asadmin
     command.   For  information  on  database  errors,  see  the
     derby.log file.
