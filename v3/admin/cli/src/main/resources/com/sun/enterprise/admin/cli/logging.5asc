NAME
     logging - logging application server events

DESCRIPTION
     The Application Server uses the Java 2 platform Logging  API
     specified  in  JSR  047. Application Server logging messages
     are recorded in the server log, normally  found  at  domain-
     dir/logs/server.log.

     The domain-dir/logs directory contains two  other  kinds  of
     logs  in addition to the server log. In the access subdirec-
     tory are the HTTP Service access logs, and in  the  tx  sub-
     directory  are the Transaction Service logs. For information
     about these logs, consult the Admin Console online help  and
     Configuring Transactions.  The components of the Application
     Server generate logging output. Application  components  can
     also generate logging output.

     Application components may use the  Apache  Commons  Logging
     Library  to log messages. The platform standard JSR 047 API,
     however, is recommended for better log configuration.
