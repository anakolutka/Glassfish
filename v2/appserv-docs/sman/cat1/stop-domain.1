OPTIONS
     -t--terse       Indicates that any output data must be  very
                     concise,  typically  avoiding human-friendly
                     sentences and favoring  well-formatted  data
                     for  consumption  by  a  script.  Default is
                     false.

                     statement on to the standard output. Default

                     fied,    the    domain    in   the   default
