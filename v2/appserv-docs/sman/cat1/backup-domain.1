DESCRIPTION
     The backup-domain command backs up  files  under  the  named
     domain. This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir             This  option  specifies  the  parent
                             directory  of  the domain upon which
                             the  command   will   operate.   The
                             default is install_dir/domains.

     --description           A description can contain any string
                             to   help  identify  the  particular
                             backup. The description is displayed
                             as  part  of the information for any
                             backup.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -v --verbose            Indicates  that   output   data   is
                             displayed with detailed information.
                             Default is false.

OPERANDS
     domain_name             This is the name of the domain to be
                             backed  up.  If  the  domain  is not
                             specified  and   only   one   domain
                             exists,  it  will  be used automati-
                             cally.
