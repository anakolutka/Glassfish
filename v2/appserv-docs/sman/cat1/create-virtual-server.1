DESCRIPTION
     The create-virtual-server command creates the named  virtual
     server. Virtualization in the Application Server allows mul-
     tiple URL domains to be served by a single HTTP server  pro-
     cess  that  is  listening on multiple host addresses. If the
     application is available at two virtual servers, they  still
     share the same physical resource pools.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to

                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other  passwords,   that   must   be

                             specified  for  remote commands, use
                             the --passwordfile or enter them  at
                             the command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                This option specifies the target for
                             which  you  are creating the virtual
                             server. Valid values are:

                               o  server, which creates the  vir-
                                  tual  server  for  the  default
                                  server instance.  This  is  the
                                  default value.

                               o  configuration_name,       which
                                  creates  the virtual server for
                                  the named configuration

                               o  cluster_name, which creates the
                                  virtual server for every server
                                  instance in the cluster

                               o  instance_name,  which   creates
                                  the  virtual  server for a par-
                                  ticular server instance

                                  This option is  available  only
                                  in the Sun Java System Applica-

     --hosts                 A comma-separated (,) list of values
                             allowed  in  the host request header
                             to  select   the   current   virtual
                             server.  Each virtual server that is
                             configured to  the  same  connection
                             group  must  have  a unique host for
                             that group.

     --httplisteners         A comma-separated (,) list  of  HTTP
                             listener  IDs.  Required  only for a
                             virtual  server  that  is  not   the
                             default virtual server.

     --defaultwebmodule      The standalone web module associated
                             with this virtual server by default.

     --state                 Determines whether a virtual  server
                             is  active  (on) or inactive (off or
                             disabled). Default is  active  (on).
                             When  inactive,  the  virtual server
                             does not service requests.

     --logfile               Name of the file where  log  entries

                                                          application. The  default  value  is
                                                          true.
                              sso-max-inactive-seconds    Specifies  the  number  of   seconds
                                                          after  which a user's single sign-on
                                                          record becomes eligible for  purging

                                                          Since single sign-on applies  across
                                                          several  applications  on  the  same

                                                          the disk. The access log is  written
                                                          when  the buffer is full or when the

                                                          means  that  each time the server is
                                                          accessed, the log message is  stored
                                                          directly to the file.
                              accessLogBufferSize         Specifies the size, in bytes, of the
                                                          buffer  where  access  log calls are
