<p>Although the EJB 1.1 and EJB 2.0 specification will continue to be supported
in Sun Java System Application Server 9, the use of the EJB 3.0 architecture is recommended to leverage
its enhanced capabilities.</p>
<p>To migrate a number of modifications are required, including within the source
code of components.</p>
<p>The modifications required to migrate from EJB 2.0 to EJB 3.0 are related to
the differences between EJB 2.0 and EJB 2.0. These differences are described in the
following topics.</p>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="abmcj.html#gbtmc">Metadata Annotations</A></p>

</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="gbtmc"></A><h2>Metadata Annotations</h2>
<p>An annotation consists of the <tt>@</tt> sign preceding the annotation
type, followed by a parenthesized list of element-value pairs. The EJB 3.0 Specification
defines a variety of annotation types such as those that specify a bean's type (<tt>@Stateless, @Stateful, @MessageDriven, @Entity</tt>), whether a bean is remotely
or locally accessible (<tt>@Remote, @Local</tt>), transaction attributes
(<tt>@TransactionAttribute</tt>), and security and method permissions (<tt>@MethodPermissions, @Unchecked, @SecurityRoles</tt>). </p>
<p>Annotations for the EJB 3.0 annotation types generate interfaces required by
the class as well as references to objects in the environment.  In many cases, defaults
can be used instead of explicit metadata annotation elements. In these cases, a developer
doesn't have to completely specify a metadata annotation to obtain the same result
as if the annotation was fully specified. For example, by default, an entity bean
(annotated by <tt>@Entity</tt>) has a default entity type of <tt>CMP</tt>, indicating that it has container-managed persistence. These defaults can
make annotating enterprise beans very simple. In fact, in many cases, defaults are
assumed when an annotation is not specified. In those cases, the defaults represent
the most common specifications. For example, container-managed transaction demarcation
(where the container, as opposed to the bean, manages the commitment or rollback of
a unit of work to a database) is assumed for an enterprise bean if no annotation is
specified. These defaults illustrate the "coding by exception" approach that guides
EJB 3.0 technology. The intent is to simplify things for developers by forcing them
to code things only where defaults are not adequate. </p>
<A NAME="abmck"></A><h2>EJB Query Language</h2>
<A NAME="indexterm-19"></A><p>EJB 3.0 has made enhancements to EJB QL to provide additional functionality.
Addition of projection, explicit inner and outer join operations, bulk update and
delete, subqueries, and group-by. Addition of a dynamic query capability and support
for native SQL queries.</p>
<p>The EJB 2.0 specification introduces a query language called <i>EJB
Query Language</i>, or <i>EJB QL</i> to correct many
of these inconsistencies and shortcomings. EJB QL is based on SQL92. It defines query
methods, in the form of both finder and select methods, specifically for entity beans
with container-managed persistence. EJB QL's principal advantage over SQL is
its portability across EJB containers and its ability to navigate entity bean relationships.</p>
<p>The EJB 1.1 specification left the manner and language for forming and expressing
queries for finder methods to each individual application server. While many application
server vendors let developers form queries using SQL, others use their own proprietary
language specific to their particular application server product. This mixture of
query implementations causes inconsistencies between application servers.</p>
<A NAME="abmcl"></A><h2>Local Interfaces</h2>
<p>Under the EJB 3.0 API, the business interface of an enterprise bean is a plain
Java interface, not an <tt>EJBObject</tt> or <tt>EJBLocalObject</tt> interface.
However, usage of the earlier  <tt>EJBObject</tt> and <tt>EJBLocalObject</tt>interface types continues to be supported under EJB 3.0.</p>
<p>With EJB 2.0, session beans and entity beans can expose their methods to clients
through two types of interfaces: a <i>remote interface</i> and
a <i>local interface</i>. The 2.0 remote interface is identical
to the remote interface used in the 1.1 architecture, whereby, the bean inherits from
RMI, exposes its methods across the network tier, and has the same capability to interact
with distributed clients.</p>
<p>However, the local interfaces for session and entity beans provide support for
lightweight access from EJBs that are local clients; that is, clients co-located in
the same EJB container. The EJB 2.0 specification further requires that EJBs that
use local interfaces be within the same application. That is, the deployment descriptors
for an application's EJBs using local interfaces must be contained within one <tt>ejb-jar</tt> file<tt>.</tt></p>
<p>In the EJB 1.1 architecture, session and entity beans have one type of interface,
a remote interface, through which they can be accessed by clients and other application
components. The remote interface is designed such that a bean instance has remote
capabilities; the bean inherits from RMI and can interact with distributed clients
across the network.</p>
<p>The local interface is a standard Java interface. It does not inherit from RMI.
An enterprise bean uses the local interface to expose its methods to other beans that
reside within the same container. By using a local interface, a bean may be more tightly
coupled with its clients and may be directly accessed without the overhead of a remote
method call.</p>
<p>In addition, local interfaces permit values to be passed between beans with
pass by reference semantics. Because you are now passing a reference to an object,
rather than the object itself, this reduces the overhead incurred when passing objects
with large amounts of data, resulting in a performance gain.</p>
<A NAME="abmcm"></A><h2>EJB 3.0 Entity Model </h2>
<A NAME="indexterm-20"></A><p>To create the session bean, a developer only needs to code a bean class and
annotate it with appropriate metadata. A session bean need not home interface, remote
interface, or deployment descriptor to code. All that is required in addition to the
bean class is a business interface, and that can be generated by default. The bean
class is coded as a plain old Java object (POJO) rather than a class that implements
an interface such as <tt>javax.ejb.SessionBean</tt>. Because the bean class
does not implement an interface such as javax.ejb.SessionBean, a developer no longer
has to implement methods such as <tt>ejbRemove, ejbActivate</tt>, or <tt>ejbPassivate</tt> in the bean class. However a developer can implement any or
all of these callbacks if they are needed. If the bean class implements one of these
callbacks, the EJB container calls it just as it does for EJB 2.1 technology.</p>
<p>The new Java Persistence API in EJB 3.0 defines a new single model for implementing
persistence in the Java platform. In EJB 3.0 technology, an entity bean class is a
concrete class. It's no longer an abstract class. </p>
<p>The EJB 2.0 specification uses the CMP model. It expanded the existing CMP to
allow multiple entity beans to have relationships among themselves. This is referred
to as <i>Container-Managed Relationships</i> (CMR). The container
manages the relationships and the referential integrity of the relationships.According
to the EJB 2.0 specification, the implementation class for an entity bean that uses
CMP is now defined as an abstract class.</p>
<p>The EJB 1.1 specification presented a more limited CMP model. The EJB 1.1 architecture
limited CMP to data access that is independent of the database or resource manager
type. It allowed you to expose only an entity bean's instance state through
its remote interface; there is no means to expose bean relationships. The EJB 1.1
version of CMP depends on mapping the instance variables of an entity bean class to
the data items representing their state in the database or resource manager. The CMP
instance fields are specified in the deployment descriptor, and when the bean is deployed,
the deployer uses tools to generate code that implements the mapping of the instance
fields to the data items.</p>
<p>The following topics are discussed in this section:</p>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="abmcj.html#abmcn">Defining Persistent Fields</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="abmcj.html#abmco">Dependency Injection</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="abmcj.html#abmcp">Message-Driven Beans</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="abmcn"></A><h3>Defining Persistent Fields</h3>
<p>In EJB 3.0, <tt>get</tt> and <tt>set</tt> methods are concrete,
not abstract. In addition, these methods can include logic, something that was not
possible previously. This is useful for actions such as validating fields. Another
improvement is that access to the persistence fields is not limited to the get and
set methods. The persistence fields are also accessible through a bean class's business
methods. One restriction however is that in EJB 3.0 technology, only methods within
the class can access persistence fields -- in other words, you cannot expose the instance
variables outside of the class.</p>
<p>The EJB 2.0 specification lets you designate an entity bean's instance
variables as CMP fields or CMR fields. You define these fields in the deployment descriptor.
CMP fields are marked with the element <tt>cmp-field</tt>, while container-managed
relationship fields are marked with the element <tt>cmr-field</tt>.</p>
<A NAME="abmco"></A><h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-21"></A><p> Previous versions of the EJB architecture forced the developer into complying
with the requirements of the EJB container in terms of providing classes and implementing
interfaces. By comparison, In EJB 3.0, dependency injection reflects the fact that
the bean tells the EJB container what it needs, and then container satisfies those
needs.</p>
<A NAME="abmcp"></A><h3>Message-Driven Beans</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-22"></A><p>EJB 3.0 enhances message-driven beans with support for interceptors. </p>
<p>Message-driven beans were a new feature introduced by the EJB 2.0 architecture.
Message-driven beans are transaction-aware components that process asynchronous messages
delivered through the Java Message Service (JMS).</p>
<A NAME="abmcq"></A><h2>Migrating EJB Client Applications</h2>
<A NAME="indexterm-23"></A><p>Existing EJB 2.1 and earlier applications are supported to run unchanged in
EJB 3.0 containers. All EJB 3.0 implementations support EJB 1.1, EJB 2.0, and EJB
2.1 deployment descriptors for applications written to earlier versions. </p>

</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="abmcr"></A><h3>Clients written to the new EJB 3.0 API</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-24"></A><p>A client written to the EJB 3.0 API may be a client of a component written to
the EJB 2.1 or earlier API. Such clients may access components written to the EJB
3.0 APIs and components written to the earlier EJB APIs within the same transaction.
Such clients access components written to the earlier EJB APIs using the EJB 2.1 client
view home and component interfaces. The <tt>EJB</tt> annotation may be used
for the injection of home interfaces into components that are clients of beans written
to the earlier EJB client view.</p>
<A NAME="gbtof"></A><h3>Declaring EJBs in the JNDI Context</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-25"></A><p>In Application Server 9, EJBs are systematically mapped to the JNDI sub-context <i>ejb/</i>. If you attribute the JNDI name <i>Account</i> to
an EJB, theApplication Server 9 automatically creates the reference <i>ejb/Account</i> in the global JNDI context. The clients of this EJB therefore have
to look up <i>ejb/Account</i> to retrieve the corresponding home
interface.</p>
<p>Let us examine the code for a servlet method deployed in Sun ONE Application
Server 6.x.</p>
<p>The servlet presented here calls on a stateful session bean, BankTeller, mapped
to the root of the JNDI context. The method whose code you are considering is responsible
for retrieving the home interface of the EJB, to enable a BankTeller object to be
instantiated, and a remote interface for this object to be retrieved, so that you
can make business method calls to this component.</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>/**
   * Look up the BankTellerHome interface using JNDI.
   */
private BankTellerHome lookupBankTellerHome(Context ctx)
      throws NamingException
{
    try
    {
      Object home = (BankTellerHome) ctx.lookup("ejb/BankTeller");
      return (BankTellerHome) PortableRemoteObject.narrow(home, 
	              BankTellerHome.class);
    }
    catch (NamingException ne)
    {
      log("lookupBankTellerHome: unable to lookup BankTellerHome" +
          "with JNDI name 'BankTeller': " + ne.getMessage() );
      throw ne;
    }
}</pre>
</td></table><br><p>As the code already uses <tt>ejb/BankTeller</tt> as an argument for
the lookup, there is no need for modifying the code to be deployed on Application Server 9.</p>
<A NAME="gbtos"></A><h3>Recap on Using EJB JNDI References</h3>
<p>This section summarizes the considerations when using EJB JNDI references. Where
noted, the consideration details are specific to a particular source application server
platform.</p>
<A NAME="gbtok"></A><h4>Placing EJB References in the JNDI Context</h4>
<p>It is only necessary to modify the name of the EJB references in the JNDI context
mentioned above (moving these references from the JNDI context root to the sub-context <i>ejb/</i>) when the EJBs are mapped to the root of the JNDI context in the
existing WebLogic application.</p>
<p>If these EJBs are already mapped to the JNDI sub-context <tt>ejb/</tt> in
the existing application, no modification is required.</p>
<p>However, when configuring the JNDI names of EJBs in the deployment descriptor
within the Sun Java Studio IDE, it is important to avoid including the prefix <tt>ejb/</tt> in the JNDI name of an EJB. Remember that these EJB references are <i>automatically</i> placed in the JNDI <tt>ejb/</tt> sub-context
with Application Server 9. So, if an EJB is given to the JNDI name <i>BankTeller</i> in its deployment descriptor, the reference to this EJB will be translated
byApplication Server 9 into <tt>ejb/BankTeller</tt>, and this is the JNDI
name that client components of this EJB must use when carrying out a lookup.</p>
<A NAME="gbtnt"></A><h4>Global JNDI context versus local JNDI context</h4>
<p>Using the global JNDI context to obtain EJB references is a perfectly valid,
feasible approach with Application Server 9. Nonetheless, it is preferable to stay as
close as possible to the J2EE specification, and retrieve EJB references through the
local JNDI context of EJB client applications. When using the local JNDI context,
you must first declare EJB resource references in the deployment descriptor of the
client part (<tt>web.xml</tt> for a Web application, <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> for an EJB component).</p>
<A NAME="abmcv"></A><h2>Migrating CMP Entity EJBs</h2>
<p>With the introduction of EJB 3.0, you can use JDO (in addition to CMP 2.0),
which is an architecture that provides a standard way to transparently persist plain
Java objects. </p>
<p>EJB 2.x and EJB 3.0 uses CMP 2.0. In order to migrate a CMP 1.1 bean to CMP
2.0, we first need to verify if a particular bean can be migrated. The steps to perform
this verification are as follows.</p>
<A NAME="gaejd"></A><h3><IMG border="0" alt="Procedure" src="graphics/procedure.gif">To Verify if a Bean Can be Migrated</h3>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>From the <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> file, go to the <tt>&lt;cmp-fields></tt> names and check if the optional tag <tt>&lt;prim-key-field></tt> is
present in the <tt>ejb-jar.xml file</tt> and has an indicated value. If
it does, go to next step.</b></p><p>Look for the <tt>&lt;prim-key-class></tt> field
name in the <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>, get the class name and get the <tt>public instance variables</tt> declared in the class. Now see if the signature
(name and case) of these variables matches with the <tt>&lt;cmp-field></tt> names
above. Segregate the ones that are found. In these segregated fields, check if some
of them start with an upper case letter. If any of them do, then migration cannot
be performed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Look into the bean class source code and obtain the java types of all
the <tt>&lt;cmp-field></tt> variables.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Change all the <tt>&lt;cmp-field></tt> names to lowercase and
construct accessors from them. For example if the original field name is <tt>Name</tt> and its java type is <tt>String</tt>, the accessor method
signature will be:</b></p><p><tt>Public void setName(String name)Public String
getName()</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Compare these accessor method signatures with the method signatures in
the bean class. If there is an exact match found, migration is not possible.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Get the custom finder methods signatures and their corresponding SQLs.
Check if there is a "Join' or "Outer join' or an "OrderBy'
in the SQL, if yes, we cannot migrate, as EJB QL does not support "joins', "Outer
join' and "OrderBy'.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Any CMP 1.1 finder, which used <tt>java.util.Enumeration,</tt> must
now use <tt>java.util.Collection</tt>. Change your code to reflect this.
CMP2.0 finders cannot return j<tt>ava.util.Enumeration</tt>.</b></p><p><A HREF="abmcj.html#abmcw">Migrating the Bean Class</A> explains how to perform the actual
migration process.</p>
</li>
</ol><A NAME="abmcw"></A><h3>Migrating the Bean Class</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-26"></A><p>This section describes the steps required to migrate the bean class to Sun Java System Application Server 9.</p>
<A NAME="gaejw"></A><h4><IMG border="0" alt="Procedure" src="graphics/procedure.gif">To Migrate the Bean Class</h4>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>Prepend the bean class declaration with the keyword <tt>abstract</tt>. </b></p><p>For example if the bean class declaration was:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>Public class CabinBean implements EntityBean // before modification</pre>
</td></table><br><p>change it to:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>abstract Public class CabinBean implements EntityBean // after 
modification</pre>
</td></table><br></li>
<li><p><b>Prefix the accessors with the keyword <tt>abstract</tt>.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Insert all the accessors after modification into the source(.java) file
of the bean class at class level.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Comment out all the <tt>cmp</tt> fields in the source file of
the bean class.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Construct protected instance variable declarations from the <tt>cmp-field</tt> names in lowercase and insert them at the class level.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Read up all the <tt>ejbCreate()</tt> method bodies (there could
be more than one <tt>ejbCreate</tt>). </b></p><p>Look for the pattern "<tt>&lt;cmp-field>=</tt><i>some value or local variable</i>',
and replace it with the expression "abstract mutator method name (<i>same value or local variable</i>)'. </p>
<p>For example, if the <tt>ejbCreate</tt> body before migration is:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>public MyPK ejbCreate(int id, String name) {
   this.id = 10*id;
   Name = name;   //1
   return null;
}</pre>
</td></table><br><p>Change it to:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>public MyPK ejbCreate(int id, String name) {
   setId(10*id);
   setName(name);   //1
   return null;
}</pre>
</td></table><br><p>Note that the method signature of the abstract accessor in <tt>//1</tt> is
as per the Camel Case convention mandated by the EJB 2.0 specification. Also, the
keyword "<i>this</i>' may or may not be present in
the original source, but it <i>must be removed</i> from the modified
source file.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Initialize all the protected variables declared in the <tt>ejbPostCreate()</tt>methods in step 5. </b></p><p>The protected variables will be equal in
number with the <tt>ejbCreate()</tt> methods. This initialization will be
done by inserting the initialization code in the following manner:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>protected String name;  //from step 5
protected int id;  //from step 5
public void ejbPostCreate(int id, String name) {
   name = getName();    /*abstract accessor*/ //inserted in this step
   id  = getId();        /*abstract accessor*/ //inserted in this step
}</pre>
</td></table><br></li>
<li><p><b>Inside the <tt>ejbLoad</tt> method, set the protected variables
to the beans' database state. </b></p><p>To do so, insert the following lines
of code:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>public void ejbLoad() {
   name = getName();    // inserted in this step
   id = getId();        // inserted in this step
   ...                  // existing code
}</pre>
</td></table><br></li>
<li><p><b>Similarly, update the beans' state inside <tt>ejbStore()</tt>so
that its database state gets updated. </b></p><p>But remember, you are not allowed
to update the setters that correspond to the primary key outside the <tt>ejbCreate()</tt>, so do not include them inside this method. Insert the following lines
of code:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>public void ejbStore() {
    setName(name);       //inserted in this step
    setId(id);           //Do not insert this if it is a part 
                           of the primary key
    ...                  //already present code
}</pre>
</td></table><br></li>
<li><p><b>Replace all occurrences of any <tt>&lt;cmp-field></tt> variable
names with the equivalent protected variable name (as declared in step 5).</b></p><p>If you do not migrate the bean, at the minimum you need to insert the <tt>&lt;cmp-version>1.</tt><i>x</i><tt>&lt;/cmp-version></tt> tag inside the <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> file at the appropriate place,
so that the unmigrated bean still works on Sun Java System Application Server 9.</p>
</li>
</ol><A NAME="abmcx"></A><h3>Migration of ejb-jar.xml</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-27"></A><A NAME="indexterm-28"></A><p>To migrate the file <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt> to Sun Java System Application Server 9, perform
the following steps:</p>
<A NAME="gaejl"></A><h4><IMG border="0" alt="Procedure" src="graphics/procedure.gif">To Migrate the EJB Deployment Descriptor</h4>
<p>To migrate the EJB deployment descriptor file, <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>,
edit the file and make the following changes.</p>
<h5>Steps</h5><ol><li><p><b>Convert all <tt>&lt;cmp-fields></tt> to lowercase.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Insert the tag <tt>&lt;abstract-schema-name></tt> after the <tt>&lt;reentrant></tt> tag. </b></p><p>The schema name will be the name of the
bean as in the <tt>&lt; ejb-name></tt> tag, prefixed with "ias_".</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Insert the following tags after the <tt>&lt;primkey-field></tt> tag:</b></p><table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>&lt;security-identity>
   &lt;use-caller-identity/>
&lt;/security-identity></pre>
</td></table><br></li>
<li><p><b>Use the SQL obtained above to construct the EJB QL from SQL.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Insert the <tt>&lt;query></tt> tag and all its nested child
tags with all the required information just after the <tt>&lt;security-identity></tt> tag.</b></p></li>
</ol><A NAME="abmcy"></A><h3>Custom Finder Methods</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-29"></A><p>The custom finder methods are the <tt>findBy</tt>... methods (other
than the default <tt>findByPrimaryKey</tt> method), which can be defined
in the home interface of an entity bean. Since the EJB 1.1 specification does not
stipulate a standard for defining the logic of these finder methods, EJB server vendors
are free to choose their implementations. As a result, the procedures used to define
the methods vary considerably between the different implementations chosen by vendors.</p>
<p>Sun ONE Application Server 6.x uses standard SQL to specify the finder logic.</p>
<p>Information concerning the definition of this finder method is stored in the
enterprise bean's persistence descriptor (<tt>Account-ias-cmp.xml)</tt> as
follows:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>&lt;bean-property>
  &lt;property>
    &lt;name>findOrderedAccountsForCustomerSQL&lt;/name>
    &lt;type>java.lang.String&lt;/type>
    &lt;value>
       SELECT BRANCH_CODE,ACC_NO FROM ACCOUNT where CUST_NO = ?
    &lt;/value>
    &lt;delimiter>,&lt;/delimiter>
  &lt;/property>
&lt;/bean-property>
&lt;bean-property>
  &lt;property>
    &lt;name>findOrderedAccountsForCustomerParms&lt;/name>
    &lt;type>java.lang.Vector&lt;/type>
    &lt;value>CustNo&lt;/value>
    &lt;delimiter>,&lt;/delimiter>
  &lt;/property>
&lt;/bean-property></pre>
</td></table><br><p>Each <tt>findXXX</tt> finder method therefore has two corresponding
entries in the deployment descriptor (SQL code for the query, and the associated parameters).</p>
<p>In Sun Java System Application Server 9 the custom finder method logic is also declarative, but
is based on the EJB query language EJB QL.</p>
<p>The EJB-QL language cannot be used on its own. It has to be specified inside
the file <tt>ejb-jar.xml</tt>, in the <tt>&lt;ejb-ql></tt> tag.
This tag is inside the <tt>&lt;query></tt> tag, which defines a query (finder
or select method) inside an EJB. The EJB container can transform each query into the
implementation of the finder or select method. Here's an example of an <tt>&lt;ejb-ql></tt> tag:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>&lt;ejb-jar>   
  &lt;enterprise-beans>     
    &lt;entity>
      &lt;ejb-name>hotelEJB&lt;/ejb-name>       
      ...       
      &lt;abstract-schema-name>TMBankSchemaName&lt;/abstract-schema-name>       
      &lt;cmp-field>
      ...       
      &lt;query>         
        &lt;query-method>           
          &lt;method-name>findByCity&lt;/method-name> 
            &lt;method-params>             
              &lt;method-param>java.lang.String&lt;/method-param> 
            &lt;/method-params>         
        &lt;/query-method>         
        &lt;ejb-ql>           
          &lt;![CDATA[SELECT OBJECT(t) FROM TMBankSchemaName 
                                    AS t WHERE t.city = ?1]]&gt;
        &lt;/ejb-ql>       
      &lt;/query>     
    &lt;/entity>   
    ...   
  &lt;/enterprise-beans> ... 
&lt;/ejb-jar></pre>
