<h1>Features and Resources </h1>
<p>
The Sun Java System Application Server Enterprise Edition 8.1 is a J2EE 1.4
platform-compatible server for the development and deployment of J2EE
applications and Java Web Services in large-scale production environments.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#whats-new">What's New</a></li>
  <li><a href="#key-features">Key Features</a></li>
  <li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="whats-new"></a>What's New</h2>
<p>
<b>Improved Administration</b>: The Application Server supports
 remote secure management of complex multi-machine enterprise
deployments using either a browser-based console or a scriptable
command line interface.
<ul>
<li><b>New Admin Console features</b> include include a completely updated UI,
an improved log viewer, a JNDI namespace browser, and integrated monitoring capabilities.
</li>
<li><b>JMX MBean API</b>
provides a rich management interface for remote, secure,
programmatic administration and monitoring using JMX.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Improved Performance:</b> Application deployment is faster, which makes
iterative application development quicker and easier.&nbsp; The runtime
performance of EJB components has also improved.</p>

<p><b>Expanded Platform Support</b>:
The Application Server supports additional operating systems, databases, 
locales, and hardware (See the Release Notes for the latest list of 
supported platforms).</p>

<p><b>Migration and Upgrade Tools</b>:
These tools enable you to verify J2EE applications for standards conformance and portability, help
with migrations from other J2EE application servers (JBoss, WebLogic,
WebSphere), and aid in upgrading from previous versions of Sun ONE Application Server / iPlanet Application
Server. <!-- link? --> </p>

<p><b>Java 2 Standard Edition 5.0 Support</b>:
The Application Server supports <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">Java 2 Standard Edition 5.0</a>,
which includes enhanced management and monitoring features and many
performance and scalability improvements.
</p>

<p>
<b>JDBC Drivers</b>: The Application Server includes DataDirect&#8482; JDBC&#8482; drivers
 for major databases. You can use these drivers for deployment.
</p>

<p><b>Web Services Security:</b> Container message security mechanisms implement
message-level authentication (for example, XML digital signature and
encryption) of SOAP web services invocations using the X.509 and username/password
profiles of the OASIS WS-Security standard.
</p>

<p><b>WS-I Profile 1.1:</b>&nbsp; As mandated by the J2EE 1.4 specification,
Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) Basic Profile 1.1 enables
interoperability for web services applications. </p>

<p><b>Backend Connectivity with iWay Adapters</b>: Sun Microsystems resells and supports
twenty-two iWay adapters to key backend systems (for example, SAP, Siebel,
Oracle, CICS, and IBM MQ Series) to help customers leverage existing IT
applications from the Application Server environment.
These adapters support the J2EE Connector Architecture 1.5
specification and web services standards (SOAP), and include developer
tools to reduce time to connect to backend applications.</p>

<!-- EE only features -->

<p><b>Sun Java Enterprise System</b>:
As a key component of the <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/javaenterprisesystem/index.html">Sun Java Enterprise System</a>,
the Application Server is tightly integrated with portal and network identity
services.
</p>

<p><b>Message Broker</b>: The
Application server includes an enterprise-class, clustering-capable
message broker that provides messaging with high performance, availability, reliability,
and scalability.
</p>

<h2><a name="key-features"></a>Key Features</h2>

<b>Java EE 5.0 Platform Support:</b> This release implements all of the specifications covered by the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/">Java EE 5.0 platform</a>. For a
complete list of the Java EE technologies included, see the Release Notes.
</p>

<p><b>High Performance</b><b>: </b>The Application Server includes a high performance EJB container,
Web container and services, and supports concurrent
message delivery with the Sun Java System Message Queue software.
</p>

<p><b>Scalability</b>: The
Application Server supports horizontal scalability through clustering
of server instances and request load balancing. It also achieves
class leading vertical scalability &#8211; supporting large
multi-processor machines.
</p>

<p><b>High Availability</b>: The Application Server includes load balancing for HTTP, IIOP, and JMS
clients; HTTP session failover support; EJB clustering and failover support; highly
available EJB timers; distributed transaction recovery; support for
rolling application upgrades; and a high availability data base for
storing the transient state of J2EE applications.</p>

<p><b>JavaServer Faces 1.1</b>: The Application Server now
supports JavaServer Faces 1.1, which simplifies building user interfaces for Java Server
applications. Developers can quickly build web applications by assembling reusable
UI components in a page, connecting the components to an application
data source, and wiring client-generated events to server-side event handlers.
</p>

<p><b>JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library 1.1</b>: The Application Server
supports the JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) 1.1,
which encapsulates core functionality common to many JSP applications.
</p>

<p><b>High Performance&nbsp; Message Delivery</b><b>: </b>This product supports concurrent
message delivery with the Sun Java System Message Queue software.
</p>

<p><b>Developer Tool Integration:</b>
The Application Server supports the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans IDE</a>
and <a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/products/jscreator/">Sun Java Studio Creator</a>.
