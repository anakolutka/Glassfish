<A NAME="abmca"></A><h2>Java EE 5 Component Standards</h2>
<A NAME="indexterm-11"></A><p>Application Server 9 is a Java EE 5 -compliant server based on the component standards
developed by the Java community. Application Server8.0 and 8.1/8.2 versions are J2EE 1,4
compatible, Application Server 7 is a J2EE v1.3-compliant server, and Sun ONE Application
Server 6.x is a J2EE v1.2-compliant server. Between the Java EE versions, there are
considerable differences with the Java EE application component APIs.</p>
<p>The following table characterizes the differences between the component APIs
used with the Java EE-compliant Application Server 9, Application Server 7, and Application
Server 6.x.</p>

</table><A NAME="abmcb"></A><h2>Java EE 5 Application Components</h2>
<p>Java EE 5 simplifies development of enterprise applications by basing them on
standardized, modular components, providing a complete set of services to those components,
and handling many details of application behavior automatically, without complex programming.
Prominent Java EE components include:</p>
<ul><li><p>Client Application</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web Application</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enterprise Java Bean (EJB)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connector</p>
</li>
<li><p>Enterprise Application Archive (EAR)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Annotations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Java EE components are packaged separately and bundled into a Java EE application
for deployment. Each component, its related files such as GIF and HTML files or server-side
utility classes, and a deployment descriptor are assembled into a module and added
to the Java EE application. A <A NAME="indexterm-12"></A>Java EE application is composed of one or more enterprise bean(s), Web,
or application client component modules. The final enterprise solution can use one
Java EE application or be made up of two or more Java EE applications, depending on
design requirements.</p>
<p>A Java EE application and each of its modules has its own deployment descriptor.
A <A NAME="indexterm-13"></A>deployment descriptor is an XML document with an .xml extension that describes
a component's deployment settings.</p>
<p>A Java EE application with all of its modules is delivered in an <A NAME="indexterm-14"></A>Enterprise Archive (EAR) file. An EAR file is a standard Java Archive
(JAR) file with an .ear extension. <A NAME="indexterm-15"></A>The EAR file contains EJB JAR files, application client JAR files and/or
Web Archive (WAR) files.</p>
<p>The migration process is concerned with moving Java EE application components,
modules, and files. For more information on migrating various Java EE components,
refer to <A HREF="abmcz.html#abmcz">Chapter&nbsp;6, Migrating from Application Server 6.x/7.x/8.x to Application Server 9</A>.</p>

<A NAME="abmcc"></A><h2>Migration and Deployment</h2>
<p>This section describes the need to migrate Java EE applications and the particular
files that must be migrated. Following successful migration, a Java EE application
is redeployed to the Application Server.</p>
<p>Redeployment is also described in this section.</p>
<p>The following topics are addressed:</p>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="abmbz.html#abmcd">Why is Migration Necessary?</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="abmbz.html#abmce">What Needs to be Migrated</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="abmbz.html#abmci">What is Deployment of Migrated Applications?</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="abmcd"></A><h3>Why is Migration Necessary?</h3>
<p>Although Java EE specifications broadly cover requirements for applications,
they are nonetheless evolving standards. They either do not cover some aspects of
applications or leave implementation details to the application providers.</p>
<p>This leads to different implementations of the application servers, also well
as difference in the deployment of Java EE components on application servers. The
array of available configuration and deployment tools for use with any particular
application server product also contributes to the product implementation differences.</p>
<p>The evolutionary nature of the specifications itself presents challenges to
application providers. Each of the component APIs are also evolving. This leads to
a varying degree of conformance by products. In particular, an emerging product, such
as the Application Server, has to contend with differences in Java EE application components,
modules, and files deployed on other established application server platforms. Such
differences require mappings between earlier implementation details of the Java EE
standard, such as file naming conventions, messaging syntax, and so forth.</p>
<p>Moreover, product providers usually bundle additional features and services
with their products. These features are available as custom JSP tags or proprietary
Java API libraries. Unfortunately, using these proprietary features renders these
applications non-portable.</p>
<A NAME="abmce"></A><h3>What Needs to be Migrated</h3>
<p>For migration purposes, the Java EE application consists of the following file
categories:</p>
<ul><li><p>Deployment descriptors (XML files)</p>
</li>
<li><p>JSP source files that contain Proprietary APIs</p>
</li>
<li><p>Java source files that contain Proprietary APIs</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="abmcf"></A><h4>Deployment descriptors (XML files)</h4>
<p>Deployment is accomplished by specifying deployment descriptors (DDs) for standalone
enterprise beans (EJB JAR files), front-end Web components (WAR files) and enterprise
applications (EAR files). Deployment descriptors are used to resolve all external
dependencies of the Java EE components/applications. The Java EE specification for
DDs is common across all application server products. However, the specification leaves
several deployment aspects of components pertaining to an application dependent on
product-implementation.</p>
<A NAME="abmcg"></A><h5>JSP source files</h5>
<p>Java EE specifies how to extend JSP by adding extra custom tags. Product vendors
include some custom JSP extensions in their products, simplifying some tasks for developers.
However, usage of these proprietary custom tags results in non-portability of JSP
files. Additionally, JSP can invoke methods defined in other Java source files as
well. The JSPs containing proprietary APIs needs to be rewritten before they can be
migrated.</p>
<A NAME="abmch"></A><h5>Java source files</h5>
<p>The Java source files can be EJBs, servlets, or other helper classes. The EJBs
and servlets can invoke standard Java EE services directly. They can also invoke methods
defined in helper classes. Java source files are used to encode the business layer
of applications, such as EJBs.Vendors bundle several services and proprietary Java
API with their products. The use of proprietary Java APIs is a major source of non-portability
in applications. Since Java EE is an evolving standard, different products can support
different versions of Java EE component APIs. This is another aspect that migration
addresses.</p>
<A NAME="abmci"></A><h3>What is Deployment of Migrated Applications?</h3>
<p>Deployment refers to deploying a migrated application that was previously deployed
on an earlier version of Sun's Application Server, or any third party application
server platforms.</p>
<p>Deploying a migrated application is described in <A HREF="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-3660">Chapter 1, "Assembling and Deploying Applications," in <i>Sun Java System Application Server Platform Edition 9.0 Application Deployment Guide</i></A>. However,
when migration activities are performed with <A NAME="indexterm-16"></A>automated tools, such as the <A NAME="indexterm-17"></A>Migration Tool for Sun Java System Application Server 9 (for Java EE applications) or the <A NAME="indexterm-18"></A>Sun ONE Migration Toolbox (for Netscape Application Servers), there might
be post-migration or pre-deployment tasks that are needed (and defined) prior to deploying
the migrated application.</p>
<p>See <A HREF="abmex.html#abmex">Chapter&nbsp;8, Migration Tools and Resources</A> for
more information about migration tools that are available.</p>
