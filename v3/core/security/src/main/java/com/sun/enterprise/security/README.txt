The LocalStrings here probably caters to different files which have moved to other modules. So just revisit all the LocalStrings files again.

Merged all modules to one. Now trying to remove jauth package since it is a pre-jsr stuff and somehow i cannot locate the classes for that.

Also removed wss directory that contains a JAXRPC systemhandler delegate or something
