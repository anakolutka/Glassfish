<a name="jdbcconnectionpooledit"></a><h4>To edit a JDBC connection pool</h4><p>The Edit JDBC Connection Pool page provides the means to change all of
the settings for an existing pool except its name.</p><ol>
<li><b>Expand the Resources, JDBC, and Connection Pools node.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the node for the pool you want to edit.</b></li>
<li><b>Edit the General Settings as follows:</b><p>The values of the general settings depend on the specific JDBC driver that is
installed. These settings are the names of classes or interfaces in the Java
programming language.</p><table><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Datasource Classname</p></td>
<td><p>The vendor-specific class name that implements the <tt>DataSource</tt> and /
or <tt>XADataSource</tt> APIs. This class is in the JDBC driver.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Resource Type</p></td>
<td><p>Choices include <tt>javax.sql.DataSource</tt>
(local transactions only), <tt>javax.sql.XADataSource</tt> (global transactions), and <tt>java.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource</tt> (local transactions, possible performance improvements).</p></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><b>Edit the Pool Settings as follows:</b><p>A set of physical database connections reside in the pool. When an application requests
a connection, the connection is removed from the pool, and when the application
releases the connection, it is returned to the pool.</p><table><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</p></td>
<td><p>The
minimum number of connections in the pool. This value also determines the number
of connections placed in the pool when the pool is first created or
when application server starts.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Maximum Pool Size</p></td>
<td><p>The maximum number of connections in the
pool.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Pool Resize Quantity</p></td>
<td><p>When the pool scales up and scales down towards the maximum
and minimum pool size respectively, it is resized in batches. This value determines
the number of connections in the batch. Making this value too large will
delay connection creation and recycling; making it too small will make it less
efficient.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Idle Timeout</p></td>
<td><p>The maximum time in seconds that a connection can remain idle in
the pool. After this time expires, the connection is removed from the pool.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Max
Wait Time</p></td>
<td><p>The amount of time the application requesting a connection will wait before
getting a connection timeout. </p></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><b>Edit the Connection Validation as follows:</b><p>Optionally, the application server can validate connections before they are passed to applications. This
validation allows the application server to automatically reestablish database connections if the database
becomes unavailable due to network failure or database server crash. Validation of connections incurs
additional overhead and slightly reduces performance.</p><table><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Connection Validation</p></td>
<td><p>Select the Required checkbox to enable
connection validation.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Validation Method</p></td>
<td><p>The application server can validate database connections in three ways: auto-commit,
metadata, and table.</p><p>auto-commit and metadata - The application server validates a connection by
calling the <tt>con.getAutoCommit()</tt> and <tt>con.getMetaData()</tt> methods. </p><p>However, because many JDBC drivers cache
the results of these calls, they do not always provide reliable validations. Check
with the driver vendor to determine whether these calls are cached or not.</p><p>table
- The application queries a database table that are specified. The table must
exist and be accessible, but it doesn't require any rows. Do not use
an existing table that has a large number of rows or a table
that is already frequently accessed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Table Name</p></td>
<td><p>If you selected table from the Validation
Method combo box, then specify the name of the database table here.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>On Any
Failure</p></td>
<td><p>If you select the checkbox labelled Close All Connections, if a single connection
fails, then the application server closes all connections in the pool and then
reestablish them. If you do not select the checkbox, then individual connections are
reestablished only when they are used.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Allow Non Component Callers</p></td>
<td><p>Enable the pool to be
used by non-component callers such as Servlet Filters and Lifecycle modules.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Non Transactional Connections</p></td>
<td><p>Enable
to return non-transactional connections.</p></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><b>Edit the Transaction Isolation as follows:</b><p>Because a database is usually accessed by many users concurrently, one transaction might update
data while another attempts to read the same data. The isolation level of
a transaction defines the degree to which the data being updated is visible
to other transactions. For details on isolation levels, refer to the documentation of
the database vendor.</p><table><tr><th><p>Parameter</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Transaction Isolation</p></td>
<td><p>Makes it possible to select the transaction isolation level for
the connections of this pool. If left unspecified, the connections operate with default
isolation levels provided by the JDBC driver.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Isolation Level</p></td>
<td><p>Only applicable if the isolation
level has been specified. If you select the Guaranteed checkbox, then all connections
taken from the pool have the same isolation level. For example, if the
isolation level for the connection is changed programmatically (with <tt>con.setTransactionIsolation</tt>) when last used,
this mechanism changes the status back to the specified isolation level.</p></td>
</tr>
</table></li>
<li><b>Edit the Properties.</b><p>In the Additional Properties table, it is possible to specify properties, such as
the database name (URL), user name, and password. Because the properties vary with database
vendor, consult the vendor&rsquo;s documentation for details.</p></li>
