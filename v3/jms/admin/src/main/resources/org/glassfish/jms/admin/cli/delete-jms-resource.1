OPTIONS
     -t --terse                  Indicates that any  output  data
                                 must  be very concise, typically
                                 avoiding   human-friendly   sen-
                                 tences    and   favoring   well-
                                 formatted data  for  consumption
                                 by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo                   Setting to true  will  echo  the
                                 command  line  statement  on the
                                 standard  output.   Default   is
                                 false.

     -I --interactive            If set to true  (default),  only
                                 the  required  password  options
                                 are prompted.

     -H --host                   The  machine  name   where   the
                                 domain  administration server is
                                 running. The  default  value  is
                                 localhost.

     -p --port                   The HTTP/S port for  administra-
                                 tion.  This is the port to which
                                 you should point your browser in
                                 order  to manage the domain. For
                                 example, http://localhost:4848.

                                 The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure                 If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to
                                 communicate   with   the  domain
                                 administration server.

                                 If you have authenticated  to  a
                                 domain  using  the asadmin login
                                 command,  then  you   need   not
                                 specify  the  --user  option  on
                                 subsequent  operations  to  this
                                 particular domain.

     --passwordfile              The --passwordfile option speci-
                                 fies  the  name,  including  the
                                 full path, of a file  containing
                                 the   password   entries   in  a
                                 specific format. The  entry  for
                                 the   password   must  have  the
                                 AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the
                                 password   name   in   uppercase
                                 letters.

                                 For  example,  to  specify   the
                                 domain   administration   server
                                 password, use an entry with  the
                                 following                format:
                                 AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,
                                 where  password  is  the  actual
                                 administrator  password.   Other
                                 passwords  that can be specified
                                 include AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                                 AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,       and
                                 AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                                 All remote commands must specify
                                 the  admin password to authenti-

                                 or  interactively on the command
                                 prompt. The asadmin  login  com-
                                 mand can be used only to specify
                                 the admin  password.  For  other
                                 passwords,  that  must be speci-
                                 fied for  remote  commands,  use
                                 the --passwordfile or enter them
                                 at the command prompt.

                                 If you have authenticated  to  a
                                 domain  using  the asadmin login
                                 command,  then  you   need   not
                                 specify   the   admin   password
                                 through    the    --passwordfile

                                 ever, this is applicable only to
                                 AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.   You
                                 will  still  need to provide the
                                 other  passwords,  for  example,
                                 AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,   as  and
                                 when required by individual com-

                                 variable will  not  be  read  by

                                 command.

     --target                    This option  helps  specify  the
                                 target from which you are delet-
                                 ing  the  JMS  resource.   Valid
