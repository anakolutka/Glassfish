NAME
     ping-connection-pool - tests if a connection pool is usable

SYNOPSIS
     ping-connection-pool
     [--help]
     pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     This command tests if a connection pool is usable  for  both
     JDBC  connection  pools  and connector connection pools. For
     example, if you create a new JDBC  connection  pool  for  an
     application  that is expected to be deployed later, the JDBC
     pool is tested with this command before deploying the appli-
     cation.

     A JDBC connection pool or a connector connection  pool  with
     authentication  can  be  created. You can either use a -pro-
     perty option to specify user, password, or other  connection
     information  using  the command line, or specify the connec-
     tion information in the xml descriptor file.

     Before pinging a connection pool, you must create  the  con-
     nection  pool with authentication and ensure that the enter-
     prise server or database is started.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.
