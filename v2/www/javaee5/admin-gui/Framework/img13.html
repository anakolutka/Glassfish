<p><h3>Notes:</h3><br>
Handlers provide a place to write Java code -- virtually everything else is inXML or a JSP.<br>
<br>
Handlers are invoked during an event, most of which are standard JATO events such as beginDisplay and endDisplay.  However, we have added new events as well, these include:  beforeCreate, afterCreate, error, and several for the LH wizard.  The event type “command” is used for handling button and href actions.<br>
<br>
I/O to and from handlers should be well defined so that validation can occur at runtime when the handlers are invoked.  The I/O definition also allows the framework to perform type conversion on these arguments.  JATO's TypeConverter is used to perform type conversions.  This class allows type mappings to be added – see the JATO documetation.<br>
<br>
Traditional JATO did not provide a convenient way to break up Java code.  Handlers are intended to be small discrete pieces of logic, enabling them to be reused more easily than a large block of code.<br>
