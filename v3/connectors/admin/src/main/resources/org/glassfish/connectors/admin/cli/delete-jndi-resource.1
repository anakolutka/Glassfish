DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jndi-resource command removes the specified  JNDI

     you execute this command.

OPTIONS

         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

         The name of the JNDI resource to be removed.
