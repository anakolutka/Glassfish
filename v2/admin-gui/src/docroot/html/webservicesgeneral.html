<a name="webservicesgeneral"></a><h3>Web Services</h3><p>Web services are software components that are made available over the Internet
using Web technologies and a standardized XML-based messaging system. Web services are
designed to be accessed by other applications and vary in complexity from
simple operations such as checking a bank account balance online to complex systems
for customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, and so on. Since they
are based on open standards such as HTTP and XML-based protocols including
SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI, Web services are hardware, programming language, and operating
system independent. This means that applications written in different programming languages and running
on different platforms can seamlessly exchange data using Web services.</p><p>The Application Server provides support to manage deployed web services through the
Administration Console as well as the Command-line interface. Similar to EJBs and
Servlets, all the deployed web services in a domain are displayed in
the Administration Console. The infrastructure to administer the web services through Administration Console
is provided by AMX MBean.</p><p>The following procedures show how to manage Web services that are packaged
either as <tt>*.ear</tt> files or as <tt>*.war</tt> files. For additional information about
Web services, see <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/819-3671/gbbjk?a=view">Chapter 14, Managing Web Services, in <i>Sun Java System Application Server 9.1 Administration Guide</i></a>.</p>
