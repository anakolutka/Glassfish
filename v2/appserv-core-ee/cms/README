For design and architecture related information on this component, 
please read the document located at the following URL:
http://appserver.red.iplanet.com/twiki/pub/Apollo/GroupMembershipServiceWithJGroups/GMS_Module_Design_Doc.html

This submodule depends on the JGroups library as a binary dependency. This library is now staged and will be available in the publish directory. build.properties has now been modified to point to the publish directory.

This sub module is now integrated with the top level EE build and will be built whenever appserv-core-ee module is built.


To build only this submodule type the following on command line:

gmake build

The jar file for this sub module will be at
<workspace>/publish/appserv-core-ee/cms/lib/cms.jar

A new tests sub directory has been added to this sub module. This module is not part of the nightly build process as it does not get automatically built when EE sources are built. This is intentional as we do not want the tests to be shipped with the product.
