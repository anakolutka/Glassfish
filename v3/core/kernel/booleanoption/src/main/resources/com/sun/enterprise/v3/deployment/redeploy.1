DESCRIPTION
     Redeploys an application that is already deployed.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

         The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user
         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile

         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is
         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For  security  reasons,  passwords   specified   as   an

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

         environment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --name
         The name of the  application that is being redeployed.

     --contextroot

         The context root of the application that is being  rede-
         ployed.  The  context root identifies the application in
         the server. The default is the name, without the  exten-
         sion, of the archive file that contains the application.

     --precompilejsp
         Specifies  whether  pages  that  are  created  with  the
         JavaServer   PagesTM   technology  ("JSPTM  pages")  are
         precomplied  during deployment.

             o    If false, JSP pages are not precompiled  during
                  deployment, but are complied at runtime.

             o    If  true,  JSP  pages  are  precompiled  during
                  deployment.
         The default is false.

     --virtualservers

         One  or  more  virtual  server  IDs.  Multiple  IDs  are
         separated by commas.

OPERANDS
     filepath
         The full path to the  archive  file  that  contains  the
         application  that  is  being  redeployed.  Whether  this
         operand is required depends on how the  application  was
         originally deployed.

             o    If the application was originally deployed from
                  a file, the filepath operand is required.

Administration Commands                                 deploy(1)

             o    If the application was originally deployed from
                  a  directory, the filepath operand is optional.
                  If this operand is omitted, the  path  for  the
                  original  deployment  is  used.  This  path  is
                  retrieved from the domain.xml file.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Redeploying a Web Application From a File

     This example redeploys the Web application  hello  from  the
     hello.war file. The application was originally deployed from
     a file.

       asadmin> redeploy --user admin --passwordfile myfile --name hello hello.war
       Command redeploy executed successfully

     Example 2 Redeploying a Web Application From a Directory

     This example redeploys the  Web  application  hellodir.  The
     application  was  originally  deployed from a directory. The
     path for the original deployment is used.

       asadmin> redeploy --user admin --passwordfile myfile --name hellodir
       Command redeploy executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully
