Administration Commands                                  login(1)

NAME
     login - lets you log in to a domain

SYNOPSIS
     login  [--terse=false] [--echo=false]
      [--host host_name] [--port port_number]
      [--secure| -s ] [ --help ]

DESCRIPTION
     Lets you log in to a domain.

     If various application server domains are created on various
     machines  (locally),  asadmin  invocation  from any of these
     machines  can   manage   the   domains   located   elsewhere
     (remotely). This comes in handy especially when a particular
     machine is chosen as an administration client and it manages
     multiple domains and servers. asadmin commands that are used
     to manage domains located elsewhere are called  remote  com-
     mands. The asadmin login command eases the administration of
     such remote domains.

     This command runs only in the interactive mode.  It  prompts
     you  for  the  admin  user  name and password. On successful
     login. the file .asadminpass will be created in user's  home
     directory. This is the same file that is modified during the
     create-domain command while using  the  --savelogin  option.
     The domain must be running for this command to run.

     The host name is stored as-is  and there will be no  resolu-
     tion  attempted  with  the  DNS.  It is enough for a user to
     login to a particular domain which  is  fully  qualified  by
     [admin-host,  admin-port]  pair  once.  Thus, if a domain is
     being administered from various machines, it  is  sufficient
     to invoke asadmin login once.

     After logging into a domain with the asadmin login  command,
     you  need  not  specify the --user and --passwordfile option
     when you  run  subsequently  run  remote  commands  on  that
     domain.

     Successive successful invocations of the same  command  with
     same parameters result in overwriting the contents of .asad-
     minpass file for the given admin host and port. The user can
     decide to overwrite the file or reject such a login.

Administration Commands                                  login(1)

     Once you have logged in to a domain, you will still need  to
     provide the host and port for the subsequent remote commands
     unless you have chosen the  default values  for  --host  and
     --port  options.  The  advantage of this command is apparent
     especially if you choose the default  host  (localhost)  and
     default admin port (4848).

     If you do not use the login command,  and you choose not  to
     get  prompted  for  admin user and admin password, you would
     invoke asadmin commands in succession like this:

     asadmin>create-jdbc-connection-pool    --user    admin    --
     passwordfile passwordfile.txt <other options> samplePool1

     asadmin>deploy --user admin --passwordfile  passwordfile.txt
     <other options> /home/myapplication.ear

     asadmin>list-components    --user    admin    --passwordfile
     passwordfile.txt <other options>

     If you now log in, you can run remote commands like this:

     asadmin>create-jdbc-connection-pool  <other  options>   sam-
     plePool1

     asadmin>deploy <other options> /home/myapplication.ear

     asadmin>list-components <other options>

     Login information is saved permanently and this  information
     can be used across multiple domain restarts.

     There is no logout command. If you want to login to  another
     domain,  invoke asadmin login with new values for --host and
     --port.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse                  Indicates that any  output  data
                                 must  be very concise, typically
                                 avoiding   human-friendly   sen-
                                 tences    and   favoring   well-
                                 formatted data  for  consumption

Administration Commands                                  login(1)

                                 by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo                   Setting to true  will  echo  the
                                 command  line  statement  on the
                                 standard  output.   Default   is
                                 false.

     -H --host                   The  machine  name   where   the
                                 domain  administration server is
                                 running. The  default  value  is
                                 lcoalhost.   If   you  login  to
                                 localhost, you need not  specify
                                 host  or port options for subse-
                                 quent remote commands.

     -p --port                   The port number  of  the  domain
                                 administration  server listening
                                 for administration requests.

     -s --secure                 If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to
                                 communicate   with   the  domain
                                 administration server.

      --help                     Displays the help text  for  the
                                 command.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the login command

     The following command logs into a domain located on  another
     machine:

       asadmin> login --host foo --port 8282
       Please enter the admin user name>admin
       Please enter the admin password>

       Trying to authenticate for administration of server at host [foo]
       and port [8282] ...
       Login information relevant to admin user name [admin] for host [foo]
       and admin port [8282] stored at [/.asadminpass] successfully.
       Make sure that this file remains protected. Information stored in this
       file will be used by asadmin commands to manage associated domain.

     Example 2 Using the login command

     The following command logs into a domain on  local  host  on
     default port.

       asadmin> login --host myhost
       Please enter the admin user name>admin
       Please enter the admin password>
       Trying to authenticate for administration of server
       at host [myhost] and port [4848] ...
       An entry for login exists for host [myhost] and port [4848], probably
       from an earlier login operation.
       Do you want to overwrite this entry (y/n)?y
       Login information relevant to admin user name [admin] for host [myhost]
       and admin port [4848] stored at [/home/joe/.asadminpass] successfully.
       Make sure that this file remains protected. Information stored in this
       file will be used by asadmin commands to manage associated domain.
