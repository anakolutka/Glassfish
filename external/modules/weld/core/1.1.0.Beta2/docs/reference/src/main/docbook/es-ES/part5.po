"Weld is the reference implementation of JSR-299, and is used by JBoss AS and "
"Glassfish to provide CDI services for Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) "
"applications. Weld also goes beyond the environments and APIs defined by the "
"JSR-299 specification by providing support for a number of other "
"environments (such as a servlet container such as Tomcat, or Java SE) and "
"additional APIs and modules (such as logging and bean utilities)."

"Some of the extensions in Weld are portable across JSR-299 implementations "
"(like the logging and bean utilities) and some are specific to Weld (such as "
"the servlet container support). Weld also provides an SPI on which to build "
"extensions, so there are several layers involved."

"If you want to get started quickly using Weld (and, in turn, CDI) with JBoss "
"AS, GlassFish or Tomcat and experiment with one of the examples, take a look "
"at <xref linkend=\"gettingstarted\"/>. Otherwise read on for a exhaustive "
"discussion of using Weld in all the environments and application servers it "
"supports and the Weld extensions."
