DESCRIPTION
     This command  displays  commonly  monitored  statistics  for
     Enterprise Server components and services.

     Note -

       Before a given component or service can be monitored,  the
       monitoring  level  of the component or service must be set
       to HIGH or LOW. To  set  the  monitoring  level,  use  the

         The valid values are as follows:

         httplistener

             For  this  type,  the  attribute  server.monitoring-
             service.module-monitoring-levels.http-service   must
             be set to LOW or HIGH.

             Displays  the  following  statistics  for  the  HTTP

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
