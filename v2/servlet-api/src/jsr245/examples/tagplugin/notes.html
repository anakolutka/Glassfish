    <title>Tag Plugin Introduction</title>
    <h2>Tag Plugins: Introductory Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Tomcat 5 provides a framework for implementing tag plugins.  The
      plugins instruct Jasper, at translation time, to replace tag handler
      calls with Java scriptlets.
      The framework allows tag library authors to implement plugins for
      their tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomcat 5 is released with plugins for several JSTL tags.  Note
      that these plugins work with JSTL 1.1 as well as JSTL 1.0, though
      the examples uses JSTL 1.1 and JSP 2.0.  
      These plugins are not complete (for instance, some item types not
      handled in &lt;c:if>).
      They do serve as examples to show plugins in action (just
      examine the generated Java files), and how they can be implemented.
