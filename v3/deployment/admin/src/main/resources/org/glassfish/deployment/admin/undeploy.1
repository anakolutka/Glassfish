DESCRIPTION
     The undeploy command removes  the  specified  deployed  com-
     ponent.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:8080/admin.

Administration Commands                               undeploy(1)

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin

Administration Commands                               undeploy(1)

         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --droptables
         If set to true, tables created by application using  CMP
         beans  during deployment are dropped. The default is the
         corresponding entry in the cmp-resource element  of  the
         sun-ejb-jar.xml  file.  If not specified, it defaults to
         the entries specified in the deployment descriptors.

     --cascade

         If set to true, it deletes all the connection pools  and
         connector resources associated with the resource adapter
         being undeployed. If set to false, the undeploy fails if
         any  pools  and  resources are still associated with the
         resource adapter. Then, either those pools and resources
         have  to  be deleted explicitly, or the option has to be
         set to true. If the option is set to false, and if there
         are  no  pools  and  resources still associated with the
         resource adapter, the resource  adapter  is  undeployed.
         This   option  is  applicable  to  connectors  (resource
         adapters) and applications.

     --target
         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created
         with the cluster  profile  or  the  enterprise  profile.
         Specifies  the  target  from  which you are undeploying.
         Valid values are:

         server

             Undeploys the  component  from  the  default  server

             instance server and is the default value.

         domain

             Undeploys the component from the domain.

         cluster_name
             Undeploys the component from every  server  instance
             in the cluster.

         instance_name

             Undeploys the  component  from  a  particular  sever
             instance.

OPERANDS
     component_name              Name of the deployed component.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Simple undeployment

     Undeploy (uninstall) an enterprise application Cart.ear.

       asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt Cart
       Command undeploy executed successfully.

     Example 2 Undeploying an  enterprise  bean  with  container-
     managed persistence (CMP)

     Undeploy a CMP bean named myejb and drop  the  corresponding
     database  tables.  In  a  production  environment,  database
     tables contain valuable information, so use the --droptables
     option with care.

       asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt --droptables=true myejb
       Command undeploy executed successfully.
