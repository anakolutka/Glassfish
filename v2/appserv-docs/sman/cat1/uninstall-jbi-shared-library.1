DESCRIPTION
     The uninstall-jbi-shared-library command uninstalls a shared

     the shared library on  the  embedded  Domain  Administration
     Server (DAS) is uninstalled.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

      --keeparchive          Setting to true retains  the  shared
                             library  that  is  stored in the DAS
                             repository. The  shared  library  is
                             retained  even if the shared library
                             is uninstalled from all  servers  in
                             the  JBI  environment.  Setting this
                             option to true enables you to  rein-
                             stall  the  shared  library from the
                             DAS  repository instead of reinstal-
                             ling  the  shared  library  from  an
                             archive file.

                             Setting to false deletes the  shared
                             library from the DAS repository when
                             the  shared  library  is  no  longer
                             installed  on  any server in the JBI
                             environment.

                             Default is false.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are   uninstalling  the  JBI  shared
                             library.  Specify this  option  only
                             if  the  shared library is installed
                             in a multiserver environment with  a

                             Domain  Administration Server (DAS).
                             If  the  shared   library   is   not
                             installed  in a multiserver environ-
                             ment with  a  DAS,  this  option  is
                             ignored. Valid values are:

                               o  server,  which  uninstalls  the
                                  JBI   shared   library  on  the
                                  embedded DAS instance. This  is
                                  the default value.

                               o  domain,  which  uninstalls  the
                                  JBI   shared   library  on  the
                                  administrative  domain  itself.
                                  Specify  domain only if you are
                                  using the cluster profile.

                               o  cluster_name, which  uninstalls
                                  the JBI shared library on every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name, which uninstalls
                                  the  JBI  shared library on the
                                  named    unclustered     server
                                  instance.

OPERANDS
     shared_library_name     The name of the JBI  shared  library
                             you want to uninstall.
