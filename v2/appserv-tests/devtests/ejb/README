Steps for running EJB Development Tests
----------------------------------------


1. Run step 2) of general appserv-tests framework configuration
in appserv-tests/QuickLook-README.txt.   

2. Make sure ant is in your path.  Also, in some cases the ant test 
clients run out of memory during the test run.  If you see this problem,
add -Xmx999m to the command that starts the ant java vm, e.g :

cat `which ant` :


(... towards bottom of ant script)

 "$JAVACMD" -Xmx999m -classpath "$LOCALCLASSPATH" -Dant.home="${ANT_HOME}" $ANT_OPTS org.apache.tools.ant.Main $ANT_ARGS "$@"

3. Run the tests.  The "all" target starts the server and the database, runs the tests, and then stops the server and database.  

  % ant all

4. The results should look something like this : 

   [exec] input file=/Volumes/Fantom1/work/v2/appserv-tests/test_resultsValid.xml
     [exec] 
     [exec] ************************
     [exec] PASSED=        <total>
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] FAILED=          0
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] DID NOT RUN=   0
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] Total Expected=<total>
     [exec] ************************
     [exec] 

( <total> is equal to the TOTAL value in the result_count.sh file.  We keep this total count up to date based on the total number of test framework PASS assertions in the set of tests run by the ant all target )
