Introduction
------------

RelaxNGCC is a parser generator. It reads a schema writtein in RELAX NG [1]
and produces a SAX-based parser, which in turn processes XML documents
that follows the schema.

RelaxNGCC allows you to quickly write code that reads XML documents,
thereby simplifies the development of XML applications.



Using RelaxNGCC
---------------

To run RelaxNGCC, type as follows:

$ java -jar relaxngcc.jar <RELAX NG grammar>

Executing the tool without any option will show you the list of available
options.



Learning RelaxNGCC
------------------

Documents are available in HTML formats. Open index.html to get to them.

If you prefer the hands-on style, the sample directory contains useful
examples for learning how RelaxNGCC works.

A couple of RelaxNGCC artiles are available online [2]
