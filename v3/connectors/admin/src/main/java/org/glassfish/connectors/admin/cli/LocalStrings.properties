create.connector.connection.pool.connectiondefinition=The name of the connection definition.
create.connector.connection.pool.steadypoolsize=The minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the pool. The default value is 8.
create.connector.connection.pool.maxpoolsize=The maximum number of connections that can be created to satisfy client request. The default value is 32.
create.connector.connection.pool.maxwait=The amount of time, in milliseconds, that a caller must wait before a connection is created, if a connection is not available.  If set to 0, the caller is blocked indefinitely until a resource is available or until an error occurs.  The default value is 60000.
create.connector.connection.pool.poolresize=Quantity by which the pool will scale-up or scale-down the number of connections. Scale-up: When the pool has no free connections, pool will scale-up by this quantity. Scale-down: All the invalid and idle connections are removed, sometimes resulting in removing connections of quantity greater than this value. Steadypoolsize will be ensured. Possible values are from 0 to MAX_INTEGER. The default value is 2.
create.connector.connection.pool.idletimeout=The maximum time, in seconds, that a connection can remain idle in the pool. After this time, the pool can close this connection. The default value is 300.
create.connector.connection.pool.isconnectvalidatereq=If the value is set to true, the connections will be checked to see if they are usable, before they are given out to the application. The default value is false.
create.connector.connection.pool.failconnection=If set to true, all connections in the pool are closed if a single validation check fails. This parameter is madatory if the is-connection-validation-required is set to true. Legal values are on, off, yes, no, 1, 0, true or false. The default value is false.
create.connector.connection.pool.transactionsupport= Indicates the level of transaction supoort that this pool will have.  Possible values are XATransaction, LocalTransaction and NoTransaction.  This attribute can have a value lower than or equal to but not higher than the resource adapter's transaction support attribute.  The resource adapter's transaction support attribute has an order of values, where XATransaction is the highest, and NoTransaction the lowest.

delete.connector.connection.pool=removes the specified connector connection pool
delete.connector.connection.pool.cascade=When set to true, it deletes all connector resources associated with the pool, apart from the pool itself. When set to false, the deletion of pool fails if any resources are associated with the pool. The resource must be deleted explicitly or the option must be set to true. The default setting is false.
delete.connector.connection.pool.connector_connection_pool_name=The name of the connector connection pool to be removed.
delete.connector.connection.pool.success=Connector connection pool {0} deleted.
