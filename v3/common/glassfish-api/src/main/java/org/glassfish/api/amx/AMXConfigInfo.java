/**
    Annotation for {@link AMXConfig} MBeans.
    <p>
    The complete ObjectName with which an MBean is registered will be generated
    based in part upon this information; additional ObjectName properties can
    (and usual are) inserted in addition to the required ones, including 
    ones that define the containment hierarchy (following the same convention
    as does JSR 77). See {@link #j2eeType} for more information.
    <p>
    To generically participate as an AMX configuration MBean, a config interface need
    only annotate itself like this:
    &lt;pre>@AMXConfigInfo(j2eeType=X-MyType)&lt;/pre>
    (where 'MyType' is the desired type).  Of course a 'nameHint' might be needed, and if
    the config is a singleton within its scope, then those values should be included.

        Should really be:
        <pre>Class&lt;? extends AMXConfig>  amxInterface() default AMXConfig.class;</pre>

        empty to use the generic default (com.sun.appserv.management.config.AMXConfig).

       <em>If a generic AMX interface is used in {@link #amxInterface},
       then the 'j2eeType' *must* be specified with j2eeType().<em>
       Defines the value of the "j2eeType" property used in an ObjectName.
       <p>
       For backward compatibility, MBeans representing V2 domain.xml elements
       should use the Glassfish V2 J2EE_TYPE defined by the V2 AMX interface.
       <p>
       The convention for the j2eeType property in the ObjectName is for camel-case
       types beginning with "X-" and ending with an appropriate suffix corresponding to
       the type of MBean.  Example:<br>
       <pre>
       amx:j2eeType=X-DomainConfig,...
       amx:j2eeType=X-ServerMonitor,...
       amx:j2eeType=X-QueryMgr,...
       </pre>
       <p>
       A further convention (consistent with the JSR 77 ObjectName approach), is that
       an MBean logically contained by another MBean must include properties in its
       ObjectName that specify its place in a tree of MBeans ("containment").
       For example:<br>
        <pre>
        amx:j2eeType=J2EEServer,name=server
        amx:j2eeType=JVM,name=jvm1234,J2EEServer=server
        amx:j2eeType=X-JVMInfo,name=na,JVM=jvm1234,J2EEServer=server
        </pre>
        In the example above, the property "J2EEServer=server" in effect defines a containment
        hierarchy ("tree") in which the j2eeType=JVM MBean is a "child" (Containee) of the
        parent ("Container") amx:j2eeType=J2EEServer,name=server .  The j2eeType=X-JVMINfo
        ObjectName continues that arrangement, specifing its parent and parent's parent.
        This convention allows traversal of registered MBeans, the ability to build a generic management
        interface which relates MBeans to each other structurally, etc.
        <p>
        The preceeding convention is enforced by the framework for config beans based on 
        information available from @Configured interfaces, relying upon the fact that registration
        of a parent ("Container") MBean must occur before registration of a child ("Containee").
