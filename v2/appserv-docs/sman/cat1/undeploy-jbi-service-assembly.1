DESCRIPTION
     The undeploy-jbi-service-assembly command undeploys  a  ser-
     vice  assembly on the specified target. If the target is not
     specified, the  command  will  be  executed  on  the  server
     instance.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     -F --force              Setting to true  forcibly  undeploys
                             the  service  assembly.  Default  is
                             false.

      --keeparchive          Setting to true retains the  service
                             assembly   that  is  stored  in  the
                             Domain Administration  Server  (DAS)
                             repository.  The service assembly is
                             retained even if the service  assem-
                             bly  is  undeployed from all servers
                             in the JBI environment. Setting this
                             option  to  true  enables you to re-
                             deploy the service assembly from the
                             DAS    repository   instead  of  re-
                             deploying the service assembly  from
                             an archive file.

                             Setting to false deletes the service
                             assembly  from  the  DAS  repository
                             when the   service  assembly  is  no
                             longer deployed on any server in the
                             JBI environment.

                             Default is false.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are  undeploying  the service assem-
                             bly. Specify this option only if the
                             service  assembly  is  deployed in a
                             multiserver   environment   with   a
                             Domain  Administration Server (DAS).
                             If  the  service  assembly  is   not
                             deployed  in  a multiserver environ-
                             ment with  a  DAS,  this  option  is
                             ignored. Valid values are:

                               o  server, which undeploys the JBI
                                  service  assembly on the embed-
                                  ded DAS instance. This  is  the
                                  default value.

                               o  domain, which undeploys the JBI
                                  service  assembly on the admin-
                                  istrative    domain     itself.
                                  Specify  domain only if you are
                                  using the cluster profile.

                               o  cluster_name,  which  undeploys
                                  the  JBI  service  assembly  on
                                  every server  instance  in  the
                                  cluster.

                               o  instance_name, which  undeploys
                                  the JBI service assembly on the
                                  named    unclustered     server
                                  instance.
