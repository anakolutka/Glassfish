
                          Hibernate Validator

  What is it?
  -----------

  This is the reference implementation of JSR 303 - Bean Validation. 
  Bean Validation defines a metadata model and API for JavaBean validation. 
  The default metadata source is annotations, with the ability to override and extend 
  the meta-data through the use of XML validation descriptors.

  History
  -------

  Prior to version 4.x Hibernate Validators was based on a different source base which 
  is not based on JSR 303. This code can be accessed via 
  http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/hibernate/validator/trunk/hibernate-validator-legacy

  System Requirements
  -------------------

  JDK 1.5 or above.

  Using Hibernate Validator
  -------------------------

  - In case you use the distribution archive from the download site, copy hibernate-validator-*.jar together
    with all jar files from lib into the classpath of your application. You can switch the slf4j binding
    jars for log4j (log4j-<version>.jar and slf4j-log4j12-<version>.jar) with the slf4j binding files of
    your choice. See http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html
    In case you are using Java 5 you have to also include all the jar files from the jdk5 subdirectory.
    The jar files contain the classes needed for using JAXB. If XML configuration is disabled via
    Configuration.ignoreXmlConfiguration the jar files from the jdk5 subdirectory don't have to be added. 

  or 

  - Add the following to your maven or ivy dependency list:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
    </dependency>

    Hibernate Validator can be found in the JBoss Maven repository: http://repository.jboss.com/maven2/
