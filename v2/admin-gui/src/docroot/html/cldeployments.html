<a name="cldeployments"></a><h3>Service Assemblies</h3>
<a name="indexterm-102"></a><a name="indexterm-103"></a><p>A Service Assembly is a collection of Service Units that provision target components
that together provide or consume specific services for an application. Service Assemblies are
typically created in a development tools environment, such as that provided by the
NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (NetBeans IDE). </p><p>From the Admin Console, you can do the following: </p>
<ul><li><p>View all the Service Assemblies, with support for sorting and for filtering by lifecycle state. To filter the Service Assemblies based on their lifecycle state, use the State drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>Deploy a Service Assembly. For steps to deploy a Service Assembly, see the section <a href="clnewdeployment1.html">To Deploy a Service Assembly</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete a Service Assembly. This removes a Service Assembly from all the targets to which it is deployed and removes the Service Assembly from the JBI repository. </p></li>
<li><p>Enable or disable a Service Assembly. Enabling or disabling Service Assemblies applies to all the targets to which the Service Assemblies are deployed. </p></li>
<li><p>View the general properties of a Service Assembly. </p></li></ul>
