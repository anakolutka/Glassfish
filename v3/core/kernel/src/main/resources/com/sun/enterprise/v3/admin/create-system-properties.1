asadmin Utility Subcommands           create-system-properties(1)

NAME
     create-system-properties - adds or updates one or more  sys-
     tem  properties  of  the  domain, configuration, cluster, or
     server instance

SYNOPSIS
     create-system-properties
     [--help]
     [ --target  target_name]
     [name=value)[:name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-system-properties subcommand adds or updates  the
     system  properties  of  a domain, configuration, cluster, or
     server instance. Shared or clustered server instances  often
     need to override attributes defined in their referenced con-
     figuration. Any configuration attribute in a server instance
     can   be   overridden  through  a  system  property  of  the
     corresponding name.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     name=value

         The name value pairs (separated by the ':' character) of
         the system properties to add to the specified target. If
         any of the system properties were previously defined, it
         will be updated with the newly specified value.
