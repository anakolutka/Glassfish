DESCRIPTION
     The delete-http-listener command removes the specified  HTTP
     listener. This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number is 4848.

Administration Commands                   delete-http-listener(1)

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user
         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile

         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is
         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, passwords specified as an environ-
         ment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
