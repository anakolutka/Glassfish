DESCRIPTION
     The create-transport command creates a transport for a  net-
     work  listener.  This  command  is  supported in remote mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --classname
         The fully qualified name of the Java class  that  imple-
         ments      the     transport.     The     default     is
         com.sun.grizzly.TCPSelectorHandler.

     --idlekeytimeout

         The idle key timeout. The default is 30 seconds.

     --readtimeout
         The amount of time the server waits  during  the  header
         and  body  parsing  phase.  The  default  is  30000 mil-
         liseconds, or 30 seconds.

     --writetimeout

         The amount of time the server waits  before  considering
         the   remote   client   disconnected  when  writing  the
         response. The  default  is  30000  milliseconds,  or  30
         seconds.

     --tcpnodelay

         If true, the default, enables TCP_NODELAY  (also  called
         Nagle's algorithm).

     --maxconnections
         The  maximum  number  of  connections  for  the  network
         listener  that  references this transport. A value of -1
         specifies no limit. The default value is 4096.

     --acceptorthreads

         The number of acceptor threads for  the  transport.  The
         recommended  value  is  the  number of processors in the
         machine. The default value is 1.

     --buffersize
         The size, in bytes, of the buffer  to  be  provided  for
         input  streams  created  by  the  network  listener that
         references this transport. The default value is 4096.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     transport-name              The name of the transport.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-transport command

     The following command creates a transport named  http1-trans
     that  uses  a  non-default number of acceptor threads and is
     not enabled at runtime:

       asadmin> create-transport --user admin1
       --passwordfile passwords.txt --host host1 --port 4848
       --acceptorthreads 100 http1-trans
       Command create-transport executed successfully.
