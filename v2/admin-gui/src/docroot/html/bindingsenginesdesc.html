<A NAME="bindingsenginesdesc"></A><h2>Binding
Components and Service Engines</h2>
<p>Binding Components are JBI components that enable pluggable
external connectivity. In the JBI environment, they provide protocol
independence for transport or communication, and access to remote services
from within the JBI framework. In this way, they serve to isolate
the JBI environment from the particular protocol by providing normalization
and denormalization from and to the protocol-specific format, allowing
the JBI environment to deal only with normalized messages.</p>
<p>Binding Components are custom built for each external protocol
and are plugged in to the JBI meta container. This architecture allows
any JBI component to communicate over any protocol or transport, such
as SOAP, JMS, and so on. There is no need to implement these protocols
in the business logic since loose coupling ensures quick assembly
of different business solutions from different combinations of business
services from a variety of systems. This flexibility gives third-party
vendor product lines the ability to offer unique SOA services.</p>
<p>During a normal JBI transaction, the Binding Component consumes
protocol-specific message data, converts it into a JBI-specified "normalized
message" and hands it off to the Normalized Message Router (NMR)
for consumption by any Service Engine. This effectively isolates the
JBI environment from the particular protocol, allowing the JBI environment
to deal only with normalized messages. On the opposite end, the Binding
Component picks up the normalized message received from the NMR, "denormalizes"
the message into a protocol-specific message, and sends it back to
the consuming client.</p>
<p>The JBI
component that provides the services is responsible for publishing
the service definition via its JSR 208 component SPI. The service
consumer and provider communicate with one another using message exchange
patterns defined in this service description. </p>
<p>Components that supply or consume services locally (within the
JBI environment) are termed Service Engines. They enable services
such as business logic, processing, transformation, and routing services.
The Application Server bundles the Java EE Service Engine,
which functions as a service provider by enabling an endpoint in NMR.
When a Java EE web service is deployed, the deployment runtime of
Application Server notifies the Java EE Service Engine so that an
endpoint is enabled in the NMR of the JBI runtime. The notification enables any composite
application deployed to the JBI runtime to access the Java EE web
service.</p>
