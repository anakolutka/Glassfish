NAME
     delete-ssl - deletes the SSL element in  the  selected  HTTP
     listener, IIOP listener, or IIOP service

SYNOPSIS
     delete-ssl
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target ]
     --type listener_or_service_type listener_id

DESCRIPTION
     Deletes the SSL element in the selected HTTP listener,  IIOP
     listener, or IIOP service.

     The listener_id is not  required  if  the  --type  is  iiop-
     service.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user

         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile
         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, passwords specified as an environ-
         ment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         This operand is valid in domains that are configured  to
         support  clusters, such as domains that are created with
         the cluster profile or the enterprise profile. Specifies
         the target on which you are configuring the ssl element.
         The following values are valid:

         server

             Specifies the server in which  the  iiop-service  or
             HTTP/IIOP listener is to be unconfigured for SSL.

         config
             Specifies  the  configuration  that   contains   the
             HTTP/IIOP  listener or iiop-service for which SSL is
             to be unconfigured.

         cluster

             Specifies  the  cluster  in  which   the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service is to be unconfigured for
             SSL. All the server instances in  the  cluster  will
             get  SSL unconfigured for the respective listener or
             iiop-service.

         instance
             Specifies  the  instance  in  which  the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service is to be unconfigured for
             SSL.

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

      --type

         The type of service or listener for  which  the  SSL  is
         deleted. The type must be one of the following types:

             o    http-listener

             o    iiop-listener

             o    iiop-service

OPERANDS
     listener_id
          The ID of the listener from which the SSL element is to
         be deleted.

         The listener_id operand is not required if the --type is
         iiop-service.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using delete-ssl

     The following example shows how to  delete  an  SSL  element
     from an HTTP listener named http-listener-1.

       asadmin> delete-ssl --user admin
       --host fuyako --port 7070 --passwordfile adminpassword.txt --type http-listener
       http-listener-1
       Command delete-ssl executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                            command executed successfully

     1                            error in executing the command
