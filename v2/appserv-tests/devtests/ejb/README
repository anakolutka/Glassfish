Steps for running EJB Development Tests
----------------------------------------

1. Set the following variables:

APS_HOME to the location of where v2/appserv-tests are checked out
S1AS_HOME to <GlassFish install location>/glassfish3/glassfish

2. Make sure ant is in your path.  

Also, in some cases the ant test clients run out of memory during the test run.  
If you see this problem, add -Xmx999m to the command that starts the ant java vm, e.g :

    % cat `which ant`


    (... towards bottom of ant script)

    "$JAVACMD" -Xmx999m -classpath "$LOCALCLASSPATH" -Dant.home="${ANT_HOME}" $ANT_OPTS org.apache.tools.ant.Main $ANT_ARGS "$@"

3. Install GlassFish by unzipping glassfish.zip for running the tests against Java EE Full Profile, or web.zip for running the tests against the Web Profile.

4. Run the tests.  

  4.1 The "all" target starts the server and the database, runs the tests, and then stops the server and database.  

     % ant all

  4.2 The "lite" target starts the server and the database, runs the tests that do not require any EJB container features beyond EJB Lite, and then stops the server and database.  

  % ant all

5. The results should look something like this : 

   [exec] input file=/Volumes/Fantom1/work/v2/appserv-tests/test_resultsValid.xml
     [exec] 
     [exec] ************************
     [exec] PASSED=        <total>
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] FAILED=          0
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] DID NOT RUN=   0
     [exec] ------------  =========
     [exec] Total Expected=<total>
     [exec] ************************
     [exec] 

( <total> is equal to the TOTAL value in the result_count.sh file.  We keep this total count up to date based on the total number of test framework PASS assertions in the set of tests run by the ant all target )

  
6. To start the server and Derby database, and to cleanup resultset, do 

   % ant setup

7. To stop the server and Derby database, and to report the result, do 

   % ant unsetup

Note: partial result will show <total>-<tests-executed> as a DID NOT RUN number
