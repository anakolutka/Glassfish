NAME
     delete-node-agent - deletes the node agent and  its  associ-
     ated directory structure

SYNOPSIS
     delete-node-agent   [--terse=false]    [--echo=false]    [--
     interactive=true] [--agentdir nodeagent_path] nodeagent_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use the delete-node-agent command to delete the  named  node
     agent  and  its  directory structure. The node agent must be
     stopped and have no associated server instances. After  suc-
     cessful  execution  of  the  command, run delete-node-agent-
     config to remove the named node agent from domain.xml.

OPTIONS
     -t--terse               Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e--echo                Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on to the stan-
                             dard output. Default is false.

     -I--Interactive         If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required options are prompted.

     --agentdir              Like a Domain Administration  Server
                             (DAS),  each node agent resides in a
                             top    level     directory     named
                             agentdir/nodeagent_name.  If  speci-
                             fied, the path must be accessible in
                             the  filesystem.  If  not specified,
                             defaults    toinstall_dir/nodeagents
                             directory.

OPERANDS
     nodeagent_name          The name of the  node  agent  to  be
                             deleted.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using delete-node-agent

     asadmin> delete-node-agent nodeagent1
     Node Agent nodeagent1 deleted.

     Where:    nodeagent1,    residing     in     the     default
     install_dir/nodeagents  directory,  is deleted together with
     its directory structure. Please  note  that  at  this  point
     nodeagent1  references  still  exist  in domain.xml. Use the
     delete-node-agent-config command  to  complete  the  removal
     process.
