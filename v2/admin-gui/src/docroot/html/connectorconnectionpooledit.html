<li><b>In the tree component, expand the Resources node and then the Connectors node.</b></li>
<li><b>Expand the Connector Connection Pools node.</b></li>
<li><b>Select the connector connection pool you want to edit.</b></li>
<li><b>On the Edit Connector Connection Pool page, you can change the settings of
this connection pool. (Optional) Under General Settings, modify the description for the connection
pool.</b></li>
<li><b>Under Pool Settings, you can specify the parameter values as explained in the
following table.</b><table><tr><td><p>Parameter</p></td>
<td><p>Description</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</p></td>
<td><p>The minimum number of connections in the
pool. This value also determines the number of connections placed in the pool
when the pool is first created or when application server starts.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Maximum Pool Size</p></td>
<td><p>The
maximum number of connections in the pool.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Pool Resize Quantity</p></td>
<td><p>When the pool scales
up and scales down towards the maximum and minimum pool size respectively, it
is resized in batches. This value determines the number of connections in the
batch. Making this value too large will delay connection creation and recycling; making it
too small will make it less efficient.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Idle Timeout</p></td>
<td><p>The maximum time in seconds
that a connection can remain idle in the pool. After this time expires,
the connection is removed from the pool.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Max Wait Time</p></td>
<td><p>The amount of time the
application requesting a connection will wait before getting a connection timeout. </p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>On Any
Failure</p></td>
<td><p>If you select the checkbox labelled Close All Connections, if a single connection
fails, then the application server will close all connections in the pool and
then reestablish them. If you do not select the checkbox, then individual connections
will be reestablished only when they are used.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Transaction Support</p></td>
<td><p>Use the Transaction Support list
to select the type of transaction support for the connection pool. The chosen
transaction support overrides the transaction support attribute in the resource adapter associated with this
connection pool in a downward compatible way. In other words, it can support
a lower transaction level than that specified in the resource adapter or the
same transaction level as that specified in resource adapter, but it cannot specify
a higher level.The transaction support options include the following. The None selection from
the Transaction Support menu indicates that the resource adapter does not support resource
manager local or JTA transactions and does not implement XAResource or LocalTransaction 
interfaces. For JAXR resource adapters, you need to choose None  from the
Transaction Support menu. JAXR resource adapters do not support local or JTA transactions. Local
transaction support means that the resource adapter supports local transactions by implementing the
LocalTransaction  interface. Local transactions are managed internal to a resource manager and involve
no external transaction managers. XA transaction support means that the resource adapter supports
resource manager local and JTA transactions by implementing the LocalTransaction and  XAResourceinterfaces. XA
transactions are controlled and coordinated by a transaction manager external to a resource
manager. Local transactions are managed internal to a resource manager and involve no
external transaction managers.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p>Connection Validation</p></td>
<td><p>Select the Required checkbox to enable connection validation.</p></td>
</tr>
