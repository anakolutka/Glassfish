     directory

SYNOPSIS
     list-domains  [--domaindir domains]
     [--terse={false|true}] [ --echo ={false|true}] [ --help ]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the list-domains command to  list  the  domains  in  the
     specified domains directory. If the domains directory is not
     specified, the domains  in  the  default  as-install/domains
     directory  are  listed.  If  there  is more that one domains
     directory, the --domaindir option must be specified.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir

         The directory where the domains are  to  be  listed.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem. If not specified, the domains in  the  default  as-
         install/domains directory are listed.

     -t --terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         to the standard output. Default is false.

     --help
         Displays the help text for the command.
