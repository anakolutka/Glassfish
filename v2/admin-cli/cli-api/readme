This is the readme for building this subcomponent.
Make sure that 
jmxri.jar - in ../../publish/JDK1.4_DBG.OBJ/jmxri/lib
jmxremote.jar in ../../publish/JDK1.4_DBG.OBJ/rjmx-ri
jmxremote_optional.jar in ../../publish/JDK1.4_DBG.OBJ/rjmx-ri
s1as-jsr160-client.jar in ../../publish/JDK1.4_DBG.OBJ/jmx-remote/rjmx-impl
are available.

To achieve this,
goto appserv module: gmake get-jdk get-rjmx-ri get-jmx get-ant get-jmx-remote.

[The above get-* operations are better on windows. If you are on solaris box,
in appserv module just do gmake bootstrap].

Run ant (ANT that is gotten from get-ant above - ../../publish/JDK1.4_DBG.OBJ/ant/bin)

Here are the supported targets.
ant all or ant - displays this message
ant compile - builds the classes
ant jar - builds the classes and jar
ant test - carries out acceptance testing, make sure that the server is running.
ant clean - cleans the things that can be re-built, namely classes, jars, test outputs etc.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU RUN ant compile BEFORE CHECKIN.
