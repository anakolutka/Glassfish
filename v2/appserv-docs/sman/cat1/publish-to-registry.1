                                     that  can talk to the regis-

                                     adapter that can talk to the
                                     UDDI registry)

                                 2.  Create a  connector  connec-
                                     tion  pool  to create a pool
                                     using the resource adapter

                                 3.  Create a connector  resource
                                     using  this connection pool.
                                     The jndiname of this connec-
                                     tor resource is specified in
                                     the registryjndinames param-

                             published. Typically in  tegistries,
                             documents  are  published for a par-

                             at all the services that the organi-
                             zation offers.
