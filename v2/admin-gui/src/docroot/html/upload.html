<A NAME="upload"></A><h3><IMG border="0" alt="Procedure" src="graphics/procedure.gif">To deploy an application</h3>
<ol><li><p><b>From the Type drop-down list, select the archive corresponding
to the application that you want to deploy.<A NAME="indexterm-13"></A> An
enterprise application is packaged in an EAR file, a type of archive
file that contains any type of Java stand-alone modules, such as WAR
and EJB JAR files.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>On the Deployment page, specify the location of the EAR
file to deploy.</b></p><p>The server machine is the host that is
running the application server domain administration server. The client
machine is the host on which you are viewing the Administration Console through
a browser.</p>
<ul><li><p><b>If the file resides on or is accessible from the client
machine, click the radio button to specify a package file to upload
to the Application Server.</b></p><p>Click Browse to browse to the file,
or type the full path to the file.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>If the file resides on the server machine, or to deploy
an un-packaged application from an exploded directory, click the radio
button to specify a package file or a directory path accessible from
the server.</b></p><p>Type the full path name to the file or directory.
Deploying from an exploded directory is for advanced developers and
is not recommended for production environments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Click Next to display the Deploy Enterprise Application
page.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>On the Deploy Enterprise Application page, specify the
settings for the application.</b></p><ol Type="a"><li><p><b>In the Application Name field, either retain the default
name, which is the prefix of the file name, or type another name. </b></p><p>The default name appears if you chose to upload a file. The
application name must be unique.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b><A NAME="indexterm-14"></A>In the Virtual Servers
field, you can replace the default <tt>server</tt>. </b></p><p>To view the available virtual servers, in the tree component
select Configuration -> HTTP Service -> Virtual Servers.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>To disable the application so that is unavailable after
deployment, deselect the Status: Enabled check box.</b></p><p>By
default, an application is available as soon as it is deployed. </p>
</li>
<li><p><b>To enable the application to use Java Web Start, select
the Java Web Start: Enabled check box. </b></p><p>Java Web Start
provides browser-independent deployment of Java client applications
that run directly in a Java VM.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>To verify the structure and contents of the file before
deployment, select the Run: Verifier checkbox. </b></p><p>Verification
of large applications can be time-consuming. Verify the file if you
suspect it is corrupt or non-portable.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>To precompile JSP pages, select the Precompile: JSPs checkbox. </b></p><p>If you do not select this checkbox, the JSP pages are
compiled at runtime when they are first accessed. Because compilation
is often time-consuming, select this option for best performance in
a production environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Enter the path to any libraries (JAR files) that the application
requires.</b></p><p>The libraries must be accessible on the server.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Optionally enter a brief text description of the application.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Choose a high availability
setting.</b></p><p>To enable high availability for the application,
select the Availability checkbox. If availability is enabled for an
application, it must also be enabled at all higher levels (named configuration
and web container or EJB container) as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Choose
the targets to which to deploy the application.</b></p><p>From the
list of available targets, choose the target or targets and click
Add. Targets can be clusters or stand-alone server instances. If you
do not select a target, the application is deployed to the default
server instance <tt>server</tt>.</p>
<p>If you are
redeploying, don't select targets. Anything you select here
is ignored. Any target clustered or stand-alone server instance that
references the deployed application automatically references the new,
redeployed application if dynamic reconfiguration is enabled for the
cluster or stand-alone instance. For more information about how to
redeploy applications without interruption of service, see "Upgrading
an Application."</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Select the Generate: RMI stubs to generate RMI stubs.</b></p><p>If you choose to generate RMI stubs, static RMI-IIOP stubs are
generated and put into the client JAR file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><b>Click OK to deploy the application.</b></p></li>
</ol>
