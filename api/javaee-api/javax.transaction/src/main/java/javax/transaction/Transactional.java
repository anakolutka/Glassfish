/**
 * Annotation used by applications to control transaction boundaries on CDI
 * managed beans, as well as classes defined as managed beans by the Java EE
 * specification such as servlets, JAX-RS resource classes, and JAX-WS
 * service endpoints, declaratively.  This provides the semantics of EJB
 * transaction attributes in CDI without dependencies such as RMI.  This
 * support is implemented via an implementation of a CDI interceptor that
 * conducts the necessary suspending, resuming, etc.  The TxType element of
 * the annotation provides the semantic equivalent of the transaction
 * attributes in EJB.
 *
 * By default checked exceptions do not result in the transactional
 * interceptor marking the transaction for rollback and instances of
 * RuntimeException and its subclasses do.  This default behavior can be
 * overridden by specifying which exceptions result in the interceptor marking
 * the transaction for rollback.  The rollbackOn element can be set to indicate
 * which exceptions should cause the interceptor to mark the transaction for
 * rollback.  Conversely, the dontRollbackOn element can be set to indicate
 * which exceptions should not cause the interceptor to mark the transaction
 * for rollback.  When a class is specified for either of these elements, the
 * designated behavior applies to subclasses of that class as well.  If both
 * elements are specified, dontRollbackOn takes precedence.
 *
 * EJB application exceptions (i.e., runtime exceptions annotated with
 *  @ApplicationException) are treated just as anyother runtime exceptions
 *  unless otherwise specified.
 *
 * When Transactional annotated managed beans are used in conjunction with EJB
 *  container managed transactions the EJB container behavior is applied before
 *  the bean is called.  When the bean is called the CDI behavior is applied
 *  before calling the bean's methods.  It is best practice to avoid such use of
 *  Transactional annotations in conjunction with EJB container managed transactions
 *  in order to avoid possible confusion.
