User Commands                                    start-appserv(1)

NAME
     start-appserv - starts the domains in the specified  domains
     directory

SYNOPSIS
     start-appserv     [--terse=false]     [--echo=false]     [--
     interactive=true]    [--user   admin_user]   [--passwordfile
     passwordfile] [--domaindir install_dir/domains]

DESCRIPTION
     This command is deprecated.  Use  the  start-domain  command
     instead.  Use the start-appserv command to start the domains
     in specified domain directory. If the  domain  directory  is
     not specified the domains in the default install_dir/domains
     directory are started. The  start-appserv  command  requires
     that the user has set  up an AS_ADMIN_USER environment vari-
     able and that all domains have the same administration user.
     You  are  prompted  for  the master password for each domain
     (unless the --savemasterpassword option was specified at the
     domain creation time).

     The  start-appserv  command  functions  correctly  if  every
     domain   is   created   with   --savemasterpassword.  If  --
     savemasterpassword is not specified, then you  are  prompted
     for the master password for every domain.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir             The directory where the domains  are
                             to  be  started.  If  specified, the
                             path  must  be  accessible  in   the
                             filesystem.  If  not  specified, the
                             domain      in      the      default
                             install_dir/domains   directory   is
                             started.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on to the stan-
                             dard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.
