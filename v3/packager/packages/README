When creating the SVR4PackageDefToFileList.xml files, the following issues
were encountered and/or the following questions raised in the SUNWaso 
package:

1) For win2k only there were a whole bunch of additional jato help files. 
I suspect that these files should not be present (as they are not packaged
on any other platform). These include lib/install/applications/*jato*/*.html.
These are currently included in SVR4PackageDefToFileList.xml, but I believe
should be removed.

2) For linux and solaris, libares3.so is present in prototype_com, but missing
from the zip files. This is a web core dll, and I believe that it should
be present; therefore, I have not excluded it from SVR4PackageDefToFileList.xml

3) Two web core files lib/libatomic.so and lib/cpu/sparcv8plus/libnspr_flt4.so
were present in prototype_com.solaris, but not present in prototype_com. I 
believe that these are the same file, that libnspr_flt4.so should be 
added to prototype_com and excluded from linux and win2k.

4) The file lib/install/templates/asenv.conf.template is present in 
prototype_com, but also present in SUNWasro/prototype_com. I believe that 
it should be removed from prototype_com.

For completeness, here is how I compared the results. In general, I 
generated a new file prototype_com.zip.XXX using SVR4PackageDefToFileList.xml
and compared it to the original prototype_com.XXX using the following:

echo off
cls
java -classpath /ias/build/appserv/components/build/src/java com.sun.appserv.internal.build.util.SVR4PackageDefToFileList SVR4PackageDefToFileList.xml

echo "WIN2K"
sort prototype_com.win2k | uniq > t 
sort prototype_com.zip.win2k | uniq > t1
diff t1 t

echo "Linux"
sort prototype_com.linux  | uniq> t 
sort prototype_com.zip.linux  | uniq> t1
diff t1 t

echo "Solaris"
sort prototype_com.solaris | uniq > t
sort prototype_com.zip.solaris | uniq > t1
diff t1 t

rm t1 t
