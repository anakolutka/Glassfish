TODO ITEMS:

New additions:

1) allows ONE host name now.  A warning is logged and I automatically do this:
  "somehost"  --->  "somehost,somehost"
2) protocol property is now checked -- it must be "rsh" or "ssh" or a warning is logged.
3) modified server.policy to give permissions to hahb/lib.  Submitted to Tony Ng for review.



From Sathyan, 4-19-04
a). Automatically generate wrapper scripts for configure-ha-cluster to 
setup a sample cluster
for availability(Create 1 cluster, 2 instances, 2 hadb nodes, jdbc 
Connection pool, jdbc resource
and configure them for availability).
I am currently working on this, will require packaging changes also.

b). Install hadbjdbc4.jar even when application server core/admin client 
is selected. I will take care of this.

c). Update server.policy file
BN: HOW???

d). remove-ha-cluster command is not complete yet. It does not remove 
the configuration done on appserver.  
BN: DONE -- except there is a bug in ResourcesMBean - it will NOT remove resource-refs to the pool.


e). Any plans on removing 'kludgeNoHadb' flag?
BN: Someday -- when Windows has HADB.  In the meantime it's needed for testing.


------ End Sathyan 4-19-04
Add logging messages
Add Javadoc
Clean up the mess from writing code too fast!!!

Beef up Exceptions -- i.e. don't allow ANY Exceptions but the declared one (HADBSetupException) out.

(Ken) Another thing to add to the issues list ... work out the naming and semantics of
create-hadb-schema and clear-hadb-schmea). They need to have equivalent functionality to
Glaucus...

hadb-jar file:
        hadbjdbc4.jar is currently installed under <InstallDir>/SUNWhadb/4/lib.
        This jar is not picked up because it is not opened up in server.policy as in 7.1.
        Connection with the DB will not be established without this jar file.
        I copied the file manually to <InstallDir>/lib and everything started working fine.
        If we package this file to <InstallDir>/lib that would open
        up packaging issues and if we put this entry in server.policy that would open
        up security issues :-) .
        Ken, your input please...

        Ken's response:  Why can't we add 

        grant codeBase "file:${com.sun.aas.hadbRoot}/lib/-" {
        permission java.security.AllPermission;
        };

device-size parameter is getting passed in but ignored by the code at runtime
properties is getting passed in but ignored by the code at runtime

Shared-Config Support:
        on a side note. We will have to figure out how to handle the shared 
        config case where 2 clusters share the same configuration. This is not 
        critical for this point, but more of a reminder to keep on your list of 
        open issues and things to work out.

** DONE ITEMS ****
create hadb database -- done
create tables (Ken did this) -- done
create connection-pool in domain.xml -- done
create jdbc-resource in domain.xml -- done
create resource-refs -- done
update availability-service -- done
Update the MBean interface -- done
Change the pool-name portions of web and ejb availability - done

Note: You can do the resource-creation steps of create-hadb in Windows.  You need to set a JVM option in domain.xml:
    kludgeNoHadb=true  
At runtime, if this is set, all the hadbm calls are skipped

Note: FAST build/test:
(1) run "ant" from <root>/admin-ee
(2) run "ant package" from <root>/installer-ee
(3) copy appserver-se.jar (created in step 2)  from publish/packager-ee/lib to <ee>/lib
