<a name="abtinstance"></a><h4>About the Application Server Instance</h4>
<p>The Application Server creates one application server instance, called <tt>server</tt> at the
time of installation. You can delete the server instance and create a new
instance with a different name if you prefer.</p><p>Each Application Server instance has its own Java configuration, Java resources, application deployment
areas, and server configuration settings. Changes to one application server instance have no
effect on other application server instances. You can have one application server instance within
one administrative domain.</p><p>For many users, one application server instance meets their needs. However, depending upon
your environment, you might want to create one or more additional application server
instances. For example, in a development environment you can use different application server instances
to test different Application Server configurations, or to compare and test different application
deployments. Because you can easily add or delete an application server instance, you
can use them to create temporary &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; areas to experiment with while developing.</p><p>In addition, for each application server instance you can also create virtual servers.
Within a single installed application server instance you can offer companies or individuals
domain names, IP Addresses, and some administration capabilities. For the users, it is
almost as if they have their own web server, without the hardware and
basic server maintenance. These virtual servers do not span application server instances. For more
information about virtual servers, see <a href="serverinstjvmgeneral.html">To configure the JVM settings</a>.</p><p>In operational deployments, for many purposes you can use virtual servers instead of
multiple application server instances. However, if virtual servers do not meet your needs,
you can also use multiple application server instances.</p><p>An Application Server instance is not started automatically. Once you start an instance,
the instance runs until you stop it. When you stop an application server
instance, it stops accepting new connections, then waits for all outstanding connections to
complete. If your machine crashes or is taken offline, the server quits and
any requests it was servicing may be lost.</p><p>See also: <a href="standaloneinstancegeneral.html">To View Server Instance Information</a>.</p>
