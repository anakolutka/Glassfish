/**
 * A Buffer is a collection that allows objects to be removed in some
 * well-defined order.  The removal order can be based on insertion order
 * (eg, a FIFO queue or a LIFO stack), on access order (eg, an LRU cache), 
 * on some arbitrary comparator (eg, a priority queue) or on any other 
 * well-defined ordering.<P>
 *
 * Note that the removal order is not necessarily the same as the iteration
 * order.  A <Code>Buffer</Code> implementation may have equivalent removal
 * and iteration orders, but this is not required.<P>
 *
 * This interface does not specify any behavior for 
 * {@link Object#equals(Object)} and {@link Object#hashCode} methods.  It
 * is therefore possible for a <Code>Buffer</Code> implementation to also
 * also implement {@link java.util.List}, {@link java.util.Set} or 
 * {@link Bag}.
