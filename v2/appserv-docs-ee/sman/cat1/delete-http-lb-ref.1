NAME
     delete-http-lb-ref - deletes the cluster or server  instance
     from a load balancer configuration

SYNOPSIS
     delete-http-lb-ref   --user    admin_user    [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     --config config_name target

DESCRIPTION
     Use the delete-http-lb-ref command to remove a reference  to
     a  cluster  or  stand-alone  server  instance  from  a  load
     balancer configuration.  So that you do not  interrupt  user
     requests,  make  sure  the standalone server instance or all
     server instances in the  cluster  are  disabled  before  you
     remove them from the load balancer configuration.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain

                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-

                             output. Default is false.

                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

                               o  cluster_name,  which  specifies
