DESCRIPTION
     The  list-jbi-service-engines  command  lists  the   service

     specified, the command will list all the  installed  service
     engines.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --lifecyclestate        Helps list the service engines based
                             on  its  current state. For example,
                             if you want to list only those  ser-
                             vice  engines  that are started, you
                             can specify -lifecyclestate started.
                             By  default, all service engines are
                             listed, regardless of their  states.
                             Valid values for this option are:

                               o  shutdown, which lists  all  the
                                  service    engines   that   are
                                  currently   shutdown   on   the
                                  specified target.

                               o  started, which  lists  all  the
                                  service engines that are in the
                                  'started' state on  the  speci-
                                  fied target.

                               o  stopped, which  lists  all  the
                                  service  engines  on the speci-
                                  fied target that are  not  run-
                                  ning.

     --libraryname           Helps list the service engines  that
                             currently use the specified library.

     --assemblyname          Helps list the service engines  that
                             have a service unit deployed as part
                             of the service  assembly  unit  with
                             the specified service assembly name.

     --target                Specifies the target for  which  you
                             want   to   list   the  JBI  service
                             engines. Specify this option only if
                             the  service engines are deployed in
                             a  multiserver  environment  with  a
                             Domain  Administration Server (DAS).
                             If  the  service  engines  are   not
                             deployed  in  a multiserver environ-
                             ment with  a  DAS,  this  option  is
                             ignored. Valid values are:

                               o  server, which lists the service
                                  engines  on  the  embedded  DAS
                                  instance. This is  the  default
                                  value.

                               o  domain, which lists the service
                                  engines  for the administrative
                                  domain itself.  Specify  domain
                                  only if you are using the clus-
                                  ter profile.

                               o  cluster_name, which  lists  the
                                  service   engines   for   every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name, which lists  the
                                  service  engines  for the named
                                  unclustered server instance.
