NAME
     delete-resource-ref - removes a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     delete-resource-ref   --user   admin_user    [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--target target] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-resource-ref command removes a reference  from  a
     cluster or an unclustered server instance to a resource (for
     example, a JDBC resource). This effectively results  in  the
     removal  of  the resource from the JNDI tree of the targeted
     instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they will no longer
     load the resource in the JNDI tree the next time they start.

     Removal of the reference does not result in removal  of  the
     resource  from  the  domain. The resource is removed only by
     the delete command for that resource (for  example,  delete-
     jdbc-resource).

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the

                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain

                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
