asadmin Utility Subcommands                create-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     create-resource-ref - creates a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-ref
     [--help]
      [ --target  target]
      [--enabled=true] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-ref command creates a reference  from  a
     cluster  or  an  unclustered server instance to a previously
     created resource (for example, a JDBC resource created using
     the  create-jdbc-resource command). This effectively results
     in the resource being made available in the JNDI tree of the
     targeted instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they  will  receive
     the new resource the next time they start.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --enabled

         Indicates whether the resource should be  enabled.  This
         value  will  take effect only if the resource is enabled
         at the global level. The default is true.

OPERANDS
     reference_name              The name or  JNDI  name  of  the
                                 resource.
