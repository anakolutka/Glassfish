Mark is the founder of Javector Software.  Javector is developing tools for SOA Integration using Java and Web Services.
</p>
<p> 
Mark has spent the last 4 years researching the use of Web Services standards (e.g., SOAP, WSDL, WS-ReliableMessaging, etc.) for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). His upcoming book, "SOA Integration using Java Web Services" (Prentice Hall) is a detailed, technical, "how to" for software architects.  He has also been a Visiting Scholar at the MIT Sloan School doing academic research on Web Services with Professor Stuart Madnick. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to founding Javector Software, Mark was the founder and president of Kinderhook Systems, Inc. - an eBusiness consulting firm. Mark sold Kinderhook to Xpedior, Inc. in 1999 and was Executive Vice President of that company until he left to start Javector. 
</p>
<p>During the 1990s, Mark was also a founder and the VP Technology at QDB Solutions, Inc. - a Cambridge, MA software company that developed tools for data quality management. After a series of mergers, the QDB tools are now a part of IBM's WebSphere suite of products marketed under the name IBM WebSphere AuditStage.

      <p>Matthew has almost 10 years of Java EE experience and enjoys
working
in Java and almost any other object-oriented language. He says his
current interests include software engineering automation and
metrics, the study of legacy systems and languages (where he hopes to
stand on the shoulders of others) and almost anything that advances
the liberation of information. He says that is why he has been an
avid participant in OpenSource projects. His first OpenSource
contributions were to JMeter and Tomcat back in the early 2000s and
has contributed numerous patches for other projects while trying to
"combat entropy and spread the message that 'Code is Poetry.'" </p>
      <p>Matthew got his start in a 15 person company and says that he
loves the small company work environment. He graduated with a BSCS
from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1999. </p>
