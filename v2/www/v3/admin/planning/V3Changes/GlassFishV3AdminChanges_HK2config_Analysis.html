      <h1><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Today&rsquo;s GlassFish V2 offers only &ldquo;2nd class citizenship&rdquo; for externally-written modules/plugins.
        GlassFish V3 proposes to change that by restructuring the GlassFish runtime to be module-based (<a href="https://hk2.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">HK2</a>),
        such that the runtime consists of a set of modules, many of which could (in theory at least) be written <em>after
        the fact</em> by users and customers.</p>
      <p>Necessary to achieving the &ldquo;any and all modules&rdquo; goal is support for configuration of user/customer-supplied
        modules. This includes the domain.xml persistence mechanism (a file), the code that parses domain.xml, and all code
        higher in the chain that uses the configuration, including the modules themselves as well as management MBeans and
        ultimately management clients such as the CLI and GUI.</p>
      <p>This page assesses the existing low-level dependency injection proposal (<a href="GlassFish_v3_low_level_config.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>)
        and provides suggestions for improvements.</p>
      <p class="sidebar"><a name="DependencyInjection" id="DependencyInjection"></a>The <strong>dependency injection</strong> design
        pattern supplies configuration (or objects supplying functionality) to a subsystem indirectly; a subsystem designates
        a configuration object or objects that are to be populated with configuration values for use by that subsystem. The
        particular mechanism by which those values of objects are obtained is opaque to the module. Furthermore, the configuration
        object(s) need not populated with values (or even instantiated) until such time as the dependent subsystem makes
        use of them. Thus, the injection mechanism accomplishes two purposes: it <strong>decouples</strong> the configuration
        value storage mechanism from the subsystem(s) which use those values and it allows <strong>deferral</strong> of initialization
        (&ldquo;lazy&rdquo;
        initialization).</p>
      <h1><a name="InjectionProposalAnalysis" id="InjectionProposalAnalysis"></a>Analysis of proposed injection approach</h1>
      <h2><a name="ConfigurationProvidersAndConsumers" id="ConfigurationProvidersAndConsumers"></a>Configuration <em>providers</em> and configuration <em>consumers</em></h2>
      <p>The injection approach proposed by the vanguard of the GlassFish V3 team utilizes the concept of <strong>configuration</strong> object(s)
          and <strong>configured</strong> object(s). Java annotations are used to designate such objects; these include the
          annotations <span class="code">@Configured</span> and <span class="code">@ConfiguredBy.</span></p>
        <p class="sidebar">The Annotation name <span class="code">@Configured</span> might be gramattically confusing for
          some; it's actually the <em>configuration itself</em>, <strong>not</strong> the thing <em>being configured</em>.
          A naming change would disambiguate the term, perhaps <span class="code">@Configuration</span> and <span class="code">@ConfiguredFrom</span> or
          <span class="code">@ConfigurationProvider</span> and <span class="code">@ConfigurationConsumer</span> &mdash; terms that
          make the relationship clear.</p>
        <h2><a name="ImplicitlyMutable" id="LazyInitialization3"></a>Implicitly mutable</h2>
        <p>The proposal contemplates the use of mutable classes (hence the thread-safety issues), with the module consuming
          the configuration (the <strong>Consumer</strong>) defining the configuration class. This
          laissez-faire approach include in which those in which the runtime module itself is the configuration object.</p>
        <h2><a name="LazyInitialization" id="LazyInitialization"></a>Lazy initialization</h2>
      <p>The proposal contemplates injecting (modifying) fields of an <span class="code">@Configured</span> class with
          values obtained through domain.xml, which is parsed as part of the HK2 startup sequence. The injection need not
          occur unless/until the <span class="code">@Configured</span> class is actually instantiated, which need happen
          until the <span class="code">@ConfiguredBy</span> class is instantiated eg the service actually needs to run.</p>
        <h2><a name="DTDOrNoDTD" id="LazyInitialization2"></a>DTD or no DTD</h2>
        <p>In GlassFish V2, the <span class="code">domain.xml</span> took precedence&mdash;the DTD was modified or extended, and
          code changes were made accordingly. This approach cannot work in a system where new modules can be loaded at will
          (except to provide the facility of dynamically generating the &ldquo;DTD du jour&rdquo;). Indeed, the DTD could change minute-by-minute!</p>
        <p>In GlassFish V3, the situation reverses: modules define configuration which in turn is stored in XML. The question
          arises as to whether a DTD is a requirement, or indeed of any value whatsoever: it would be quite possible to parse
          the XML purely according to XML syntax, avoiding the DTD altogether. This approach would omit certain  validity
          checks for fields, but sidesteps the need to constantly regenerate a DTD&mdash;a real chore if modules are slightly different
          and/or dynamically loaded on a regular basis.</p>
        <p>Another question that arises is how to generate XML without a DTD describing the elements to be generated. One
          could sidestep the DTD and use the same facilities that propose to generate a DTD, and instead simply generate
          XML directly from the Java configuration objects.</p>
        <h2><a name="ConcreteClasses" id="ConcreteClasses"></a>Concrete classes for <span class="code">@Configured</span></h2>
      <p>The proposal suggests that values will be injected into a concrete <span class="code">@Configured</span> class
          (instance). This class is part of and written by the module (service) developer. It contains additional annotations
          including <span class="code">Attribute</span> (confusingly the same as a javax.management.Attribute). There is
          nothing that precludes a module developer from mixing &ldquo;apples with oranges&rdquo;; an <span class="code">@Configured</span> class therefore could
          be a mix of configured values, other non-configured values, and an arbitrary number of methods (static or otherwise),
          etc.</p>
        <p>The flexibility of using concrete classes for configuration does offer <strong>one key advantage</strong>: the
          concrete class can easily insert &ldquo;reactive&rdquo; or &ldquo;preventive&rdquo; code into setting methods.
          For example, a setPort() method could insert code that rejects port numbers outside a certain range and/or actively
          closes down the current port and opens another one.</p>
        <p>On the negative side, a concrete class offers a great deal of rope for the developer to hang him/herself with:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>thread-safety</strong> &mdash; is left to the developer.</li>
          <li><strong>field access</strong> &mdash; can be <span class="code">public</span>, <span class="code">protected</span> or <span class="code">private</span>;
            security risks might exist with public fields, but at the very least dubious programming is not discouraged.</li>
          <li><strong>state consistency</strong> &mdash; the HK2 infrastructure cannot necessarily assume that the <span class="code">@Configured</span> object
            cannot or will not change fields on its own accord, leading to inconsistency of disk/memory state, along with
            failure to notify external interested parties of such changes;</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="AlternativesToConcreteClasses" id="AlternativesToConcreteClasses"></a>Alternatives to concrete classes</h2>
      <p>A Java <span class="code"><strong>interface</strong></span> offers a clear alternative to the use of concrete
          <span class="code">@Configured</span> class. Use of an interface brings with it the ability to change the implementation
          at-will without impacting the module itself; the resulting flexibility offers a number of advantages:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>One need not annotate the getter/setter methods in the interface; they can be assumed.</li>
          <li>The <em>implementation</em> can be supplied by the module framework, eliminating the need for the module developer
            to write an implementation.</li>
          <li>Thread-safety can be guaranteed by the framework-supplied implementation.</li>
          <li>Semantics of changes with respect to the data store can centralized.</li>
          <li>Alternative paths to changing the configured become impossible (good!).</li>
          <li>Hooks can be supplied so that both the module (service) can take intercept and/or take action when changes
            to configuration are attempted.</li>
          <li>A generic implementation can avoid the need for the complexity of general purpose injection; the only needed
            injected vague would be the implementation of the configuration.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The last item above is of <strong>particular interest to the administrative area</strong>: the ability to implement the following
          features could make use of such a hook for various purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>pseudo-transactional operation</strong> &mdash; it is desirable to be able to &ldquo;bulk set&rdquo; attributes
            where all values are either accepted or rejected as a group. This is not feasible when values are mutated one
            by one, or <span class="code">setAttr1()</span>, <span class="code">setAttr2()</span>, etc is invoked, say in
            a loop.</li>
          <li><strong>MBeans by nature</strong> &mdash; today&rsquo;s AMX layer is the top level of 3 layers (not counting
            other intermediate hooks). An implementation of a configuration interface need not limit itself to that functionality;
            it could <strong>simultaneously</strong> be an MBean (for example).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="ProposedChanges" id="ProposedChanges"></a>Proposed  changes to dependency injection design</h1>
      <p>The <a href="#InjectionProposalAnalysis">preceding</a> analysis of the existing injection proposal should
        be prior to reading this section.</p>
      <p>The real advantages of the dependency injection approach  and include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the decoupling of configuration management and
          storage from the <em>consumer</em> of that configuration.</li>
        <li>an ability for a module to describe its own configuration conveniently in Java classes, without regard for any
          exterior structure or storage format;</li>
        <li>the means by which a general-purpose framework can accommodate new modules or services generically within its
          own configuration methodology.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Easily  forgotten is that the  ability of an exterior framework to dynamically inject (&ldquo;whack&rdquo;)
        configuration at any time is a <strong>design liability</strong>, resulting in thread-safety and notification issues.</p>
      <p>While the <a href="GlassFish_v3_low_level_config.pdf" target="_blank">existing proposal</a> contemplates concrete
        classes, and these are desirable in some ways, concrete classes introduce thread-safety issues, notification issues,
        force a layering in order to implement MBean and administration support, and generally incur the expense of more
        complicated code in order to perform the injection stage. None of this is necessary or desirable, nor does it achieve
        greater benefits.</p>
      <p>Proposed changes to the design offer several advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a guarantee of thread-safe changes to configuration;</li>
        <li>a means by which injected values can be validated prior to injection;</li>
        <li> a means by which notification is  provided to the Dependant when values have been injected;</li>
        <li>minimal effort by the developer to specify configuration</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="SimpleThings" id="SimpleThings"></a>Simple things should be really simple</h2>
      <p>Doing something basic should require minimal effort, so long as it does not sacrifice important principles. The
        most basic configuration should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;friendly&rdquo; access eg get() and set() methods;</li>
        <li>thread safety;</li>
        <li>ability to detect (and reject)  changes to configuration;</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Annotations</strong> defy the simplicity principle; many developers have never used them (and they ought
        not to have to).
        <strong>Thread-safety</strong> is even less well-understood, and much harder for some developers to grasp, let alone
        get right. <strong>Validating</strong> configuration  is highly desirable, as is the ability <strong>notify</strong> the consumer
        of the configuration, as well as 3rd party code which might alter its behavior in response.</p>
      <h3><a name="ConcreteClass" id="ConcreteClass"></a>A concrete class</h3>
      <p>Suppose a developer wishes to expose two configuration values, <span class="code">host</span> and <span class="code">port</span>.
        The simplest approach is to   use  a concrete class, declaring fields for all desired values.</p>
      <pre class="code-block">@Configured public final class MyConfig {
    String host;
    int port;
    int min, max, default;      //  min &lt;= default &lt;= max
    String notForInjection;	    // internal stuff, not for injection
}</pre>
      <p>The concrete <em>class</em> shown above neatly captures the intent but suffers from multiple issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>thread-safety
          in the face of later changes, both individual fields as well as &ldquo;visibility&rdquo; across multiple changes;</li>
        <li>inability to validate values that might depend on each other (eg min/default/max);</li>
        <li>the framework
          must <em>layer</em> something
          on top of this class for MBean and other support, etc;</li>
        <li>if the class has a member which is <em>not</em> intended
          for injection, then <em>all</em> items must be annotated in order to distinguish the injected vs non-injected
          items.</li>
        <li>the class can include all sorts of irrelevant state which is not related to configuration;</li>
        <li>there can be a mix of fields and method (eg int port; setPort(), getPort()). These become ambiguous.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the above shortcomings can be addressed by using immutable classes eg ones where the fields are <span class="code">final</span>,
        substituting entirely new objects each time configuration changes. But this raises the complexity of the injection
        code, requiring dynamic code generation of <em>constructors</em> in order to accommodate <span class="code">final</span> fields.</p>
      <h3><a name="TheInterfaceAlternative" id="TheInterfaceAlternative"></a>The interface alternative</h3>
      <p>A Java interface allows the framework to deliver the same configuration data
        in a way that solves all the issues, while requiring essentially the same work from the module developer. It allows
        get/set methods for use by both the module and anything else familiar with that interface.</p>
      <pre class="code-block">@Configured public interface MyConfig {
    String getName();	// immutable

    String getHost();
    void setHost( String host );

    int getPort();
    void setPort( int port );
}</pre>
      <p>As a Java <em>interface</em>, the framework can (lazily) provide an implementation (possibly more than one!) that
        supplies the required configuration values in a <strong>thread-safe
        manner at any time</strong>. The implementation could be dynamic, it could be an immutable object, etc. Such flexibility
        might prove useful in a pseudo-transactional system, or a bulk-set system.</p>
      <p>Changing (setting) a parameter by <em>anything</em> from <em>anywhere</em> will be seen
        by the framework (since it supplies the implementation); compare that power to a concrete class implemented by the
        module itself; &ldquo;internal&rdquo; changes
        simply cannot be detected by the framework without polling the configuration object for new values.</p>
      <p>Note that annotations (eg <span class="code">@FromAttribute)</span> are <strong>not needed</strong> here; this goes
        back to the simplicity principle. With concrete classes, annotating all methods or fields might be required simply
        because there is one field which is not to be injected. The use of an interface sidesteps that issue; by implication <em>all</em> items
        in the interface are destined for dependency injection, and thus do not require any annotation. There might be 
        exceptions for sub-elements
        which are other <span class="code">@Configured</span> objects  (though a smart implementation
        might simply detect that situation).</p>
      <p>An interface
        can also state that a particular value is immutable by declaring only the <span class="code">get()</span> method,
        and no corresponding <span class="code">set()</span>        method. This requirement exists today, where the names
        of many items are indeed immutable (at least in the current implementation); the name is set once the time the XML
        element is first created.</p>
      <p>By extending some specific base interface, modules could also gain useful generic functionality; for example <span class="code">MyConfig</span>        could
        extend a framework-supplied interface <span class="code">GlassFishConfig</span> which adds the ability to iterate
        through the available configuration:</p>
      <pre class="code-block">public interface GlassFishConfig {
    List&lt;String&gt; getValueNames();
    Object       getValue( String valueName );
    Object       getDefaultValue( String valueName );
    void         setValue( Object value );
}</pre>
      <p>The implementation of an interface can be <strong>generic</strong>, and it can simultaneously
        be an <strong>MBean</strong>.
        It can provide facilities for internal hooks for <strong>validation</strong>. It can support &ldquo;pushing&rdquo; configuration
      changes to remote servers. Some of those things can be done with concrete classes, but additional layering is required.</p>
      <p class="warning">MORE TO COME &mdash; NOT YET COMPLETE</p>
      <h1><a name="Conclusions" id="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h1>
      <p>Dependency injection is a more complicated topic than it might first seem. In a complex managed environment such
        as GlassFish, the particular implementation of injection <em>matters</em>; making the right choice can pre-solve
        many problems.</p>
