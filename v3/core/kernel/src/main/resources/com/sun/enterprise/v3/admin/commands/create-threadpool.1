NAME
     create-threadpool - adds a thread pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-threadpool [--help] [--target target_name] [--idle-timeout idle_thread_timeout_in_seconds]
     [--maxthreadpoolsize max_threadpool_size] [--minthreadpoolsize min_threadpool_size]
     [max-queue-size max-queue-size] [--workqueues number_work_queues] threadpool_id

DESCRIPTION
     The create-threadpool subcommand creates a thread pool  with
     the  specified  name.  You  can  specify maximum and minimum
     number of threads in the pool, the maximum queue  size,  and
     the idle timeout of a thread. The created thread pool can be
     used for servicing IIOP requests and for  resource  adapters
     to  service  work  management requests. A thread pool can be
     used in multiple resource adapters.

     This subcommand is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help
     -?

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --idle-timeout

         Specifies the amount of time in seconds after which idle
         threads are removed from the pool. Default is 900.

     --maxthreadpoolsize
         Specifies the maximum number of  threads  the  pool  can
         contain. Default is 5.

     --minthreadpoolsize

         Specifies the minimum number of  threads  in  the  pool.
         These  are created when the thread pool is instantiated.
         Default is 2.

     --max-queue-size

         Specifies the maximum number of  messages  that  can  be
         queued  until  threads  are available to process them. A
         value of -1 specifies no limit,  which  is  the  optimal
         value  for  a  thread  pool  used with an IIOP listener.
         Default is 4096.

     --workqueues
         Identifies the total number of work queues  serviced  by
         this threadpool.

OPERANDS
     threadpool_id

         An ID for the work  queue;  for  example,  threadpool-1,
         threadpool-2, and so forth.

EXAMPLES
