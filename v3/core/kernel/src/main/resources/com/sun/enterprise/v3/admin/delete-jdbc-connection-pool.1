     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jdbc-connection-pool command deletes a JDBC  con-
     nection  pool.  The  operand  identifies the JDBC connection
     pool to be deleted.

     Ensure that all associations to this  resource  are  removed
     before executing the delete-jdbc-connection-pool command.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

Administration Commands            delete-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user

         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile
         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is

Administration Commands            delete-jdbc-connection-pool(1)

         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, passwords specified as an environ-
         ment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --cascade
         If the option is set to true,  all  the  JDBC  resources
         associated  with  the  pool, apart from the pool itself,
         are deleted. When set to false,  the  deletion  of  pool
         fails  if  any  resources  are associated with the pool.
         Resources must be deleted explicitly or the option  must
         be set to true. By default, the option is false.

     --target

         This option is deprecated.

OPERANDS
     connectionpoolid            The name of the JDBC resource to
                                 be removed.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the delete-jdbc-connection-pool command

       asadmin delete-jdbc-connection-pool --user admin --passwordfile passwords.txt
       --host localhost --port 7070 --cascade=false sample_derby_pool

       Command delete-jdbc-connection-pool executed correctly.

     Where: asadmin is the command prompt  and  sample_derby_pool
     is the JDBC connection pool to be removed.
