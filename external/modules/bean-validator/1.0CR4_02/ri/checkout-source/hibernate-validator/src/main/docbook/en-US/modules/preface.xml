    <para>Validating data is a common task that occurs throughout any
    application, from the presentation layer to the persistence layer. Often
    the same validation logic is implemented in each layer, proving time
    consuming and error-prone. To avoid duplication of these validations in
    each layer, developers often bundle validation logic directly into the
    domain model, cluttering domain classes with validation code which is
    really metadata about the class itself.</para>

    <para>JSR 303 - Bean Validation - defines a metadata model and API for
    entity validation. The default metadata source is annotations, with the
    ability to override and extend the meta-data through the use of XML. The
    API is not tied to a specific application tier or programming model. It is
    specifically not tied to either the web tier or the persistence tier, and
    is available for both server-side application programming, as well as rich
    client Swing application developers.</para>
