     guration or profiler element of the domain.xml file.

     interactive=true]   [--host  localhost]  [--port  4848]  [--

     (jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value)
     [:jvm_option_name=jvm_option_name*]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-jvm-options command creates JVM  options  in  the
     Java  configuration  or  profiler elements of the domain.xml
     file. If JVM options are created for a  profiler,  they  are
     used  to record the settings needed to get a particular pro-
     filer going.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

     You must restart the server for newly created JVM options to
     take  effect.   Use the start/stop-domain command to restart
     the domain administration server.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin

                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are  creating  jvm  options.   Valid
                             targets are config, instance,  clus-
                             ter,   or  server.  The  default  is
                             server.

     --profiler              Indicates whether  the  JVM  options
                             are  for  the profiler. The profiler
                             must exist for  this  option  to  be
                             true.

OPERANDS

     jvm_option_name         The left side of the equal sign  (=)
                             is  the  JVM  option name. The right
                             side of the equal sign  (=)  is  the
                             JVM  option  value. A colon (:) is a
                             delimiter for multiple options.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the create-jvm-options command

     JVM options must start with a dash (-).  Use  the  backslash
     (\) to escape the dash delimiter.
