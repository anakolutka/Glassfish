NAME
     generate-jvm-report - shows the  threads,  classes,  memory,
     and loggers for a given target instance.

SYNOPSIS
     generate-jvm-report
     [--help]
     [ --type =summary|memory|class|thread|log] [target]

DESCRIPTION
     This command creates a report that shows the  threads  (dump
     of  stack  trace),  classes,  memory, or loggers for a given
     target instance, including the domain administration  server
     (DAS).  This  command works only with the application server
     instance processes.

     This command provides an alternative to  sending  Ctrl+Break
     or kill -3 signals to application server processes to obtain
     a stack trace for processes that are hanging.

     The information in the report is obtained from managed beans
     (MBeans) and MXBeans that are provided in the Java Platform,
     Standard Edition (Java SE ) or  JDKTM  software  with  which
     Sun GlassFishTM Enterprise Server is being used.

     If Enterprise Server is running in the Java Runtime Environ-
     ment  (JRETM)  software  from   JDK  release 6 or Java SE 6,
     additional information is provided, for example:

         o    System load on the available processors

         o    Object  monitors  that  are   currently   held   or
              requested by a thread

         o    Lock objects that a thread is holding, for example,
              ReentrantLock  objects  and  ReentrantReadWriteLock
              objects

     If the JRE software cannot  provide  this  information,  the
     report contains the text NOT_AVAILABLE.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.  The  command
     does not work if the target server instance is not running.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --type
         The type of report that is to be generated.

         summary

             Displays  summary  information  about  the  threads,
             classes, and memory (default).

         memory
             Provides information about heap and non-heap  memory
             consumption,  memory  pools,  and garbage collection
             statistics for a given target instance.

         class

             Provides information about the class  loader  for  a
             given target instance.

         thread
             Provides information about threads running  and  the
             thread   dump  (stack  trace)  for  a  given  target
             instance.

         log

             Provides information  about  the  loggers  that  are
             registered in the Virtual Machine TMr the Java plat-
             form (Java Virtual Machine or  JVM   machine).

             The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and  "JVM"  mean  a
             Virtual Machine for the Java platform.

OPERANDS
     target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
