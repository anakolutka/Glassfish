<p>TestNG</p>
<p>Defining a Test</p>
<p>In TestNG, the basic unit of testing remains a Java <i>method</i>. </p>
<p>From a higher level of organizing a lot of tests however, the unit of testing 
  is a test-suite that is defined in terms of an XML. The structure of a test-suite 
  is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="testng-dtd.jpg" width="873" height="658" align="absmiddle"></p>
<p>Thus, a test-suite comprises of various tests which themselves may comprise 
  of <i>groups</i>, Java packages, Java classes. At the same time, a test-suite 
  can contain groups that can be included or excluded. A test Java class can be 
  configured to only include certain methods and exclude others. Thus, there is 
  a lot of flexibility in terms of defining the test-suites.</p>
<p>It is important for us to understand that there is an interplay between the 
  testng.xml that defines a test-suite and various Java test classes and methods 
  that are being run as part of this test-suite. In other words, just by changing 
  the attributes of elements in test-suite definition (i.e. testng.xml), the same 
  test classes and/or methods can be run differently, <i>without recompiling</i> 
  the test classes. Note that the classes must use TestNG Annotations in order 
  to be run by TestNG TestRunner. </p>
<p>One should look at the definition of test-suite(s) as a way to conveniently 
  arrange various tests to deliver a collection of tests to create either periodically 
  run tests or quickly investigate certain problems. It imparts configurability 
  to already written tests. In general, well written tests should have predictable 
  behavior and hence running them as part of various test-suites should present 
  desired results.</p>
<p>The flexibility in defining the test-suite as an XML is further amplified by 
  the way to run <i>testng</i> tests using any of the integrated ways. For the 
  sake of convenience, we use <i>ant</i>. Thus a defined test-suite can be run 
  in such a way so as to pick only certain test <i>classes</i> and/or certain 
  <i>groups</i>. Because of this, a test-suite can be run differently without 
  not only recompiling test classes, but also without changing the test-suite 
  definition.</p>
<p>Once a set of test-suites is defined, making a test a part of any test-suite 
  is mostly automatic. This is because if a certain structure is followed (for 
  instance) while using the package names of the tests, those tests could implicitly 
  be included in the test-suite.</p>
