DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to list the security maps belonging to  the
     specified connector connection pool.

     For this command to succeed, you must have first  created  a
     connector   connection   pool  using  the  create-connector-
     connection-pool command.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,

                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the

                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --verbose               Returns a list including  the  iden-
                             tity, principals, and security name.

     --securitymap           Specifies the name of  the  security
                             map  contained  within the connector
                             connection pool from which the iden-
                             tity   and   principals   should  be
                             listed. With this option,  --verbose
                             is redundant.

OPERANDS
     connector_connection_pooNamemeof  the  connector  connection
                             pool  for  which  you  want  to list
                             security maps.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using list-connector-security-maps with the secu-
     rity map option

     It is assumed that  the  connector  pool  has  already  been
     created using the create-connector-pool command.

     asadmin> list-connector-security-maps --user admin
     --passwordfile pwd_file --securitymap securityMap1 connector-Pool1
     Command list-connector-security-maps executed successfully.

     One  security  map  (securityMap1)   is   listed   for   the
     connector-Pool1 pool.

     Example 2: Using  list-connector-security-maps  without  the
     security map option

     It is assumed that  the  connector  pool  has  already  been
     created using the create-connector-pool command.

     asadmin> list-connector-security-maps --user admin --passwordfile pwd_file.txt connector-Pool1
     Command list-connector-security-maps executed successfully.

     All  security  maps  contained  within  connector-Pool1  are
     listed.

EXIT STATUS
     0                        command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
