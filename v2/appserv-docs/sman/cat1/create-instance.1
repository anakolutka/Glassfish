DESCRIPTION
     Use the create-instance  command  to  create  a  new  server
     instance residing on a local or remote machine. For a server
     instance to be functional it must have:

       o  A reference to a node agent, which defines the  machine
          where the server instance resides.

       o  A reference to a configuration, which defines the  con-
          figuration  of  the instance. A server instance that is
          joining a cluster receives its configuration  from  its
          parent cluster.

     The node agent does not need to be  created  or  started  to
     create  the instance; however, if the node agent is running,
     a remote server instance is created in a stopped  state.  If
     the  node  agent  is not running, domain.xml is updated with
     the instance  information  and  a  new  server  instance  is
     created the next time the node agent is started.

     There are three  types  of  server  instances  that  can  be
     created. Each server instance can only be of one type:

     1.  Standalone server instance: the configuration  for  this
         instance  is not shared by any other server instances or
         clusters. When a standalone server instance is  created,
         a  standalone configuration is also created based on the
         default-config configuration.  If  no  configuration  or
         cluster  is  identified, a standalone server instance is
         created by default.The name of this  configuration  will
         be  server-name-config  where server-name represents the
         name of an unclustered  server  instance.   Formally,  a
         standalone  server  instance  has  a configuration named
         server-name-config and is the only instance  referencing
         this configuration.

     2.  Shared  server  instance:  the  configuration  for  this
         instance  is shared with other server instances or clus-
         ters. A server instance is considered shared if its con-
         figuration is shared by any other server instances.

     3.  Clustered server instance: the  configuration  for  this
         instance  is shared with other instances in the cluster.
         A server instance that is a member of the cluster inher-
         its  its  configuration  from  that  cluster. Any server
         instance that is not part of a cluster is considered  an
         unclustered server instance. Standalone server instances
         and  shared   server   instances   can   be   considered
         unclustered server instances.

     When creating server instances, Application Server  attempts
     to  resolve  possible port conflicts. It also assigns random
     ports, currently not in use  and  not  already  assigned  to
     other   instances  on  the  same  node  agent.  Use  the  --
     systemproperties option to create  additional  instances  on
     the same node agent and specify system properties to resolve
     the port conflicts. System  properties  can  be  manipulated
     after instance creation using the system property commands.

OPTIONS
     --nodeagent             The name of the node agent  defining
                             the machine where the server will be
                             created. The  node  agent  does  not
                             need  to be running or even created.
                             If the node agent does not exist,  a
                             placeholder  will  automatically  be
                             created in domain.xml.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.

                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to

                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --config                Creates a  shared  server  instance.
                             The  configuration  name  must exist
                             and must not be named default-config
                             or  server-config. If the configura-
                             tion name provided is  a  standalone
                             configuration,     an    error    is
                             displayed.

                             The --config and  --cluster  options
                             are  mutually exclusive. If both are
                             omitted,   a    standalone    server
                             instance is created.

     --cluster               Creates a clustered server  instance
                             that inherits its configuration from
                             the named cluster.

     --lbweight              Helps assign weight for  the  server
                             instance

     --systemproperties      Defines system  properties  for  the
                             server  instance.  These  properties
                             override property definitions in the
                             server   instance's   configuration.
                             Currently, these properties allow  a
                             way  for  a server instance to over-
                             ride port settings  defined  in  its
                             configuration.  This is necessary if
                             for example two clustered  instances
                             (sharing   the  same  configuration)
                             reside on the same machine. The fol-
                             lowing properties are available:
