     delete-ssl - deletes the SSL element in  the  selected  HTTP
     listener, IIOP listener, or IIOP service

SYNOPSIS
     delete-ssl
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target ]
     --type listener_or_service_type listener_id

DESCRIPTION
     Deletes the SSL element in the selected HTTP listener,  IIOP
     listener, or IIOP service.

     The listener_id is not  required  if  the  --type  is  iiop-
     service.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:8080/admin.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile
         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         This operand is valid in domains that are configured  to
         support  clusters, such as domains that are created with
         the cluster profile or the enterprise profile. Specifies
         the target on which you are configuring the ssl element.
         The following values are valid:

         server

             Specifies the server in which  the  iiop-service  or
             HTTP/IIOP listener is to be unconfigured for SSL.

         config
             Specifies  the  configuration  that   contains   the
             HTTP/IIOP  listener or iiop-service for which SSL is
             to be unconfigured.

         cluster

             Specifies  the  cluster  in  which   the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service is to be unconfigured for
             SSL. All the server instances in  the  cluster  will
             get  SSL unconfigured for the respective listener or
             iiop-service.

Administration Commands                             delete-ssl(1)

         instance

             Specifies  the  instance  in  which  the   HTTP/IIOP
             listener  or  iiop-service is to be unconfigured for
             SSL.

      --type
         The type of service or listener for  which  the  SSL  is
         deleted. The type must be one of the following types:

             o    http-listener

             o    iiop-listener

             o    iiop-service

OPERANDS
     listener_id

          The ID of the listener from which the SSL element is to
         be deleted.

         The listener_id operand is not required if the --type is
         iiop-service.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using delete-ssl

     The following example shows how to  delete  an  SSL  element
     from an HTTP listener named http-listener-1.

       asadmin> delete-ssl --user admin
       --host fuyako --port 7070 --passwordfile adminpassword.txt --type http-listener
       http-listener-1
       Command delete-ssl executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                            command executed successfully
