This Maven project takes a javax.javaee-api.jar and strip the implementation classes.
The original script, run.sh and DIY.java are provided by: Roberto.Chinnici@Sun.COM 

To execute:

mvn -Djavaee.api=<location of javax.javaee-api.jar> clean install

Maven will copy the dependencies activation.jar and mail.jar to a tmp directory in target.  It will compile DIY.java and run the script, run.sh, to generate the compacted javax.javaee-api.jar with the stipped implementation classes.

The output is called javax.javaee-api-compact.jar.
