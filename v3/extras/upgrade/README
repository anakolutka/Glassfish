Instructions for building and running upgrade tool.

To build, you must have Java 6 and Maven 2.0.9 installed (error messages
in the build process will give you the exact versions). From the
'upgrade' directory run:

  mvn clean install

To install and run:

- Set JAVA_HOME if not already set.

- Copy target/upgradeTool.jar to ${v3_install}/glassfish/modules.
  Note: ${v3_install} must point to a v3, non v3-prelude, installation.

- Copy src/main/scripts/asupgrade(.bat) to ${v3_install}/glassfish/bin.
  chmod +x asupgrade if it isn't executable already.

- Run asupgrade or asupgrade.bat script. With no arguments it will
  bring up the GUI. Arguments are:
    asupgrade -c    -> Runs the cli
    asupgrade -help	-> Shows all options
