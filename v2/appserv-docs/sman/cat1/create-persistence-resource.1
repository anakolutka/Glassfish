DESCRIPTION
     The create-persistence-resource  command  registers  a  per-
     sistence  resource. This command is supported in remote mode
     only.

     The options --jdbcjndiname and --connectionpoolid are  mutu-
     ally exclusive; only one should be used.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,

                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the

                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --enabled               Determines whether the  resource  is
                             enabled at runtime.

     --target                Specifies the target for  which  you
                             are creating a persistence resource.
                             Valid targets are:

                               o  server, which deploys the  com-
                                  ponent  to  the  default server
                                  instance. This is  the  default
                                  target.

                               o  domain, which deploys the  com-
                                  ponent to the domain.

                               o  cluster_name, which deploys the
                                  component   to   every   server
                                  instance in the cluster.



                               o  instance_name,  which   deploys
                                  the  component  to a particular
                                  sever instance.

                             This option is available only in the
                             Sun  Java  System Application Server
                             Standard and Enterprise Editions.

     --jdbcjndiname          Specifies  the  JDBC  resource  with
                             which   database   connections   are
                             obtained. It must be the name of  an
                             existing JDBC resource.

     --connectionpoolid      This  option  and  the   option   --
                             jdbcjndiname are mutually exclusive.
                             If --connectionpoolid is  specified,
                             then a jdbc resource will be created
                             behind the scenes with 'PM' suffixed
                             to  the  persistence  resource name.
                             See example.

     --factoryclass          Deprecated, and not needed  for  the
                             default  CMP implementation.  Speci-
                             fies the class that creates the per-
                             sistence manager instance.

     --description           Specifies a text description of  the
                             persistence resource.

     --property              Specifies optional name/value  pairs
                             for   configuring   the  persistence
                             resource.

OPERANDS
     jndi_name               Specifies the JNDI name of the  per-
                             sistence resource.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using create-persistence-resource

     asadmin> create-persistence-resource --user admin --passwordfile passwords.txt
     --jdbcjndiname jdbc/sample sample_persistence_resource
     Command create-persistence-resource executed successfully

     Example 2: Using create-persistence-resource

     asadmin> create-persistence-resource --user admin --passwordfile passwords.txt
     --connectionpoolid testPool testPersistence
     Command create-persistence-resource executed successfully

     This command creates a jdbc resource with the name  testPer-
     sistencePM  referencing  testPool.  When you delete the per-
     sistence resource, the jdbc resource created by this command
     is also removed.

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
