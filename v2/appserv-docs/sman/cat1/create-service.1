NAME
     create-service -  configures the starting of a DAS  or  node
     agent on an unattended boot.

SYNOPSIS
     create-service --passwordfile  passwordfile  [--name  servi-
     cename] [--type das | nodeagent] [--serviceproperties servi-
     ceproperties] domain-or-node-agent-configuration-directory

DESCRIPTION
     Configures the starting of a DAS or node agent on  an  unat-
     tended boot.
      On Solaris 10, this command  uses  the  Service  Management
     Facility  (SMF).  This is a local command. This command must
     be run as the OS-level user with superuser  privileges.  For
     AS  9.0, this is available only for Solaris 10. This command
     creates the service and the user has to start, enable,  dis-
     able, delete, or stop the service. The DAS/node-agent confi-
     guration must be stored on a folder to which the  super-user
     has  access. The configuration cannot be stored on a network
     file system. This command creates the service such  that  it
     is  controlled  by  the  OS-level  user, who owns the folder
     where the configuration of the DAS or node agent resides.

     To run this command, you must have solaris.smf.*  authoriza-
     tion.  See  the useradd and usermod manpages to find out how
     to set the authorizations. It  is  also  essential  for  the
     users  to  have  write  permission  in  the  directory tree:
     /var/svc/manifest/application/SUNWappserver.  Usually,   the
     super-user  has both these permissions. If one wishes to run
     these commands as non-root user, then the system administra-
     tor  must  be  contacted so that the relevant authorizations
     are granted.

     You need to also ensure that:

       o  Solaris 10  administration  commands  such  as  svccfg,
          svcs,  and  auths  are  available  in the PATH, so that
          these commands can be executed. A simple test to do  so
          is to issue the command, which svccfg on a bash shell.

       o  You  should  have  write  permission  for   the   path,
          /var/svc/manifest/application.

OPTIONS
     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specified for-
                             mat.  The  entry  for  the  password
                             must have the AS_ADMIN_ prefix  fol-
                             lowed   by   the  password  name  in

                             capital  letters.  For  example,  to
                             specify  the  domain  administration
                             server password, use an  entry  with
                             the         following        format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     --name                   Indicates the name of  the  service
                             and   overrides   the   default,  if
                             present.

     --type                   Specifies whether the service  per-
                             tains  to  DAS or node agent.  Valid
                             values are das  and  node-agent  and
                             the default value is das, indicating
                             that  the  user's  domain  will   be
                             created as a service by default.

     --serviceproperties      Specifies a colon(:)-separated list
                             of   various   properties  that  are
                             specific to the service. For Solaris
                             10, if you specify net_privaddr, the
                             service's processes will be able  to
                             bind to the privileged ports (<1024)
                             on the platform.  You  can  bind  to
                             ports< 1024 only if the owner of the
                             service is super-user, this  is  not
                             allowed.      If     you     specify
                             startinstances=true/false, when  the
                             type    is   node-agent,   all   the
                             instances  are  started   when   the
                             node-agent starts up.

OPERANDS
     domain-dir or node-agent-The absolute path of  directory  on
                             disk that contains the configuration
                             of the domain  or  node  agent.  For
                             example,  if  your domain resides at
                             /var/SUNWappserver/appserver/domains/domain1,

                             specify this absolute path.
