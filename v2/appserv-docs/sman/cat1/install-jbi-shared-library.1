     library into the JBI environment.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --upload                When this option is set to true, the
                             command  uploads  the  file  to  the
                             administration server. The  file  is
                             uploaded to the $JBI_HOME/tmp direc-
                             tory on  the  Domain  Administration
                             Server     (DAS),    for    example,
                             $AS_INSTALL_DIR/domains/domain_name/jbi/tmp.
                             If  the  filepath of the installable
                             file  is  mounted  to   the   server
                             machine,  or  if  the administration
                             server is running locally,  set  the
                             upload option to false.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are   installing   the   JBI  shared
                             library. Specify this option only if
                             you  are  installing  the JBI shared
                             library in a multiserver environment
                             with  a  DAS. If you are not instal-
                             ling the JBI  shared  library  in  a
                             multiserver  environment with a DAS,
                             this option is ignored. Valid values
                             are:

                               o

                                  server, which installs the  JBI
                                  shared  library on the embedded
                                  DAS  instance.  This   is   the
                                  default value.

                               o  domain, which installs the  JBI
                                  shared  library on the adminis-
                                  trative domain itself.  Specify
                                  domain  only  if  you are using
                                  the cluster profile.

                               o  cluster_name,  which   installs
                                  the JBI shared library on every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name,  which  installs
                                  the  JBI  shared library on the
                                  named    unclustered     server
                                  instance.
