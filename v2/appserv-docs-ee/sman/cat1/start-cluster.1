NAME
     start-cluster - starts a cluster

SYNOPSIS
     start-cluster --user  admin_user  [--passwordfile  filename]
     [--host   localhost]   [--port   4849]   [--secure|-s]   [--
     terse=false]  [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--autohadboverride true|false] cluster_name

DESCRIPTION
     The start-cluster command attempts to start all  non-running
     instances  in  the  cluster that are reachable through their
     node agent. In  other  words,  some  instances  may  not  be
     started  if  their  node  agent is not running.  In Sun Java
     System Application Server Enterprise Edition,  this  command
     can  also start the HADB database associated with a cluster,
     depending upon the cluster's autohadb  setting  and  whether
     you   override  it  using  this  command's  autohadboverride
     option.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,

                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --hadboverride          This option is available only in the
                             Sun  Java  System Application Server

                             Enterprise Edition. The hadboverride
                             option  determines  whether to over-
                             ride the cluster's setting  for  the
                             autohadb  option.  When  the cluster
                             was created, the autohadb option was
                             set to signal whether the HADB data-
                             base  associated  with  the  cluster
                             would   be   started,   stopped,  or
                             deleted   when   the   cluster   was
                             started,  stopped,  or  deleted. You
                             can override this  value  using  the
                             hadboverride option. If hadboverride
                             is set to true, the HADB database is
                             started when the cluster is started.
                             If set to false, the  HADB  database
                             is  not  started when the cluster is
                             started. If the hadboverride  option
                             is  not  set,  the default is to use
                             the cluster's autohadb setting.

OPERANDS
     cluster_name            The  name  of  the  cluster  to   be
                             started.
