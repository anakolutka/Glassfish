     Highgly Available

     configure-ha-cluster   --user   admin_user   [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--devicesize  devicesize  ] [--haagentport port_number] [--

DESCRIPTION
     The  configure-ha-cluster  command  performs  the  following
     tasks:

       o  Verifies that the cluster exists.

       o  Verifies that the cluster is standalone (an example  of
          this  is, that the cluster doesn't share its configura-
          tion with any other cluster).

       o  Checks if a database with the same name as the  cluster
          already  exists. If so, an error is logged and the com-
          mand performs the next task.

       o  Creates an HA database with the same name as the  clus-
          ter.

       o  Creates the correct tables in the database.

       o  Creates and/or modifies the  appropriate  resources  in
          domain.xml.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option

                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard

                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

      --devicesize           This is the device size in MegaBytes
                             (MB).  The  valid  range  is between
                             208MB and 8+ gigabytes (GB).

      --haagentport          This is the number of the  HA  agent
                             port. The default is 1862.

      --haadminpassword      This is the HA administrator's pass-
                             word.

      --haadminpasswordfile  The  file   containing   the   high-
                             availability   password   associated
                             with  the  administrative  instance.
                             The  password is defined in the fol-
                             lowing                         form:
                             HADBM_ADMINPASSWORD=password,
                             HADBM_DBPASSWORD=password,
                             HADBM_SYSTEMPASSWORD=password. Where
                             password is the actual  HA  adminis-
                             trator password for the domain.

      --packagepath          A fresh installation  of  the  high-
                             availability  does not have a domain
                             nor its packagepath registered. This
                             can  cause problems when you wish to
                             use HADB on a remote machine in cer-
                             tain  cases. If the remote machine's
                             HADB root directory  does  not  have
                             exactly the same directory structure

                             as the client  machine's,  then  the
                             registration  of  the remote machine
                             will fail. There are 3 ways to  han-
                             dle this situation:

                                 1.  Register the packagepath and
                                     domain   manually   on   the
                                     remote machine with hadbm.

                                 2.  Run the  following  commands
                                     locally    on   the   remote
                                     machine to bootstrap it:

                                       o  create-cluster c1

                                       o  configure-ha-cluster
                                          --devicesize   208   --
                                          hosts hostname,hostname
                                          c1

                                       o  remove-ha-cluster c1

                                       o  delete-cluster c1

                                     After these steps the remote
                                     machine's  HADB will be con-
                                     figured properly forever.

                                 3.  Use the--packagepath option.
                                     to  identify  the  HADB-root
                                     path on the remote  machine.
                                     This  is  the path you would
                                     use if you were logged on to
                                     the remote machine.

      --hosts                This is a list  of  comma  separated
                             host  names  where the HADB instance
                             is configured. The number  of  hosts
                             must  be  greater than 1 and must be
                             an even number. The same host  names
                             can be repeated. Use fully qualified
                             hostnames when specifying the  host-
                             list interfaces explicitly for hosts
                             with multiple network interfaces.

      --property             This   is   a   list   of   property
                             name/value    pairs,    which    are
                             separated by a colon.

OPERANDS
     clusterName             This is the name of the cluster that
                             will  be  changed to high availabil-
                             ity.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the configure-ha-cluster command

     This is a basic example of how the cammand is used.

     asadmin>configure-ha-cluster --user admin --passwordfile passwordfile
     --hosts red.iplanet.com.host1,red.iplanet.com.host2 cluster1
     The command configuration-ha-cluster has executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0               command executed successfully

     1               error in executing the command
