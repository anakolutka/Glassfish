NAME
     export - marks a variable name for automatic export  to  the
     environment of subsequent commands in multimode

SYNOPSIS
     export  [ name=value  [ name=value]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The export command  marks  a  variable  name  for  automatic
     export to the environment of subsequent commands. All subse-
     quent commands use the  variable  name  value  as  specified
     unless  you unset them or exit multimode.  If only the vari-
     able name is specified, the current value of  that  variable
     name is displayed. If the export command is used without any
     arguments, a list of all the exported  variables  and  their
     values  is  displayed.  Exported shell environment variables
     set prior to  invoking  the  asadmin  utility  are  imported
     automatically  and set as exported variables within asadmin.
     Unexported environment variables cannot be read by the asad-
     min utility.

OPERANDS
     name=value              variable   name   and   value    for
                             automatic  export to the environment
                             to be used by subsequent commands.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using export command

     asadmin> export
     AS_ADMIN_USER = admin
     AS_ADMIN_HOST = bluestar
     AS_ADMIN_PREFIX = server1.jms-service
     AS_ADMIN_PORT = 8000

     Example 2: using export command to set an environment  vari-
     able

     asadmin> export AS_ADMIN_HOST=bluestar

     Example 3: Using export command to set multiple  environment
     variables

     asadmin> export AS_ADMIN_HOST=bluestar AS_ADMIN_PORT=8000
     AS_ADMIN_USER=admin AS_ADMIN_PREFIX=server1.jms-service
     In this case, the environment variables have been set to:
     host is set to bluestar
     port is set to 8000
     administrator user is set to admin

     prefix is set to server1.jms-service
