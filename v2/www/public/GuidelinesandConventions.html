<p>This page describes the rules and conventions for developing
GlassFish.&nbsp; All developers must follow the processes&nbsp;
described below when delivering code into GlassFish.&nbsp; You can view

<h3><a name="Workspace_Guidelines"></a>Workspace Guidelines</h3>
<p>This clarifies the processes related to the GlassFish workspace.
Please
be familiar with these guidelines if you work on the
workspace.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-Module Coordination</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Please use the <a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated"
 href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/GlassFishModuleOwners">module
owner list</a>&nbsp; to communicate changes that may affect others. For
example:
    <ul>
      <li>Change interfaces that other modules depend on</li>
      <li>Upgrade Component to a new major version, e.g. Ant 1.4.1 to
1.5, EJB API 2.0 to 2.1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Before putback, you will need to ensure the complete workspace
can be built. This is especially important if there are interfaces
changes and multiple modules depend on the interface.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protected Modules</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The modules <code>glassfish </code>and <code>bootstrap</code>
should not be modified without specific approval. Please email <a
 href="mailto:dev@glassfish.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish.dev.java.net</a>
if you need to modify them. Please provide a brief explanation and CVS
diffs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Binary Dependencies</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Please avoid checking in any binaries, in particular JAR files,
into the workspace. We want to avoid having multiple versions of the
same JAR file in the workspace. </li>
  <li>Please email <a href="mailto:dev@glassfish.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish.dev.java.net</a>
if you need to add binary dependencies. You will need to provide the
URL
of an official release or promoted build of the binaries and also the
official version/build number of the binaries. They will be copied to a
well-known location managed by release engineering and can be used by
multiple modules</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Packaging and DTD Changes</strong></p>
<p>Please email <a href="mailto:dev@glassfish.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish.dev.java.net</a>
if you need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add or change the files you expose in the final product image</li>
  <li>Make changes to the server configuration DTD. Note that any
changes
may require admin, CLI, and GUI changes.</li>
  <li>Make changes to Application Server-specific deployment descriptor
DTDs. Note that any
changes may require DOL, deploytool, and Sun Java System Studio changes.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Loggine_Guidelines"></a>Logging Guidelines</h3>
<p>The following <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/logging/GlassFishLog_guidelines.html">presentation</a>
discusses the logging guidelines used in
GlassFish.</p>
<h3><a name="Coding_Conventions"></a>Coding Conventions</h3>
<p>All code developed for GlassFish must follow the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/">Java Coding Conventions.</a></p>
<h3><a name="Commit_Procedures"></a>Commit Procedures</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Nightly Builds</span><br>
<p>All nightly builds start everyday at Midnight PST.&nbsp; Please hold
commits around that time for one hour so we have time to checkout the
source and start
the builds on all platforms.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>General Check-in Procedures</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Have your code reviewed by appropriate engineer(s)</li>
  <li>If you change code outside of your area, you must discuss the
changes with
the corresponding module owners/tech leads (see the <a
 href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Projects/GlassFishModuleOwners">module
owner list</a>) <br>
  </li>
  <li>If you have changed only files in a single module and have not
deleted files then do
    <ul>
      <li>maven clobber </li>
      <li>maven checkout bootstrap build</li>
      <li>maven configure-runtime</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you delete or move files around or modify code in more than
one module then do
    <ul>
      <li>maven clobber </li>
      <li>maven checkout bootstrap-all build</li>
      <li>maven configure-runtime</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run appropriate set of regression tests based on the scope and
riskiness of your change. You are responsible for figuring out the
right set of tests to run before check-ins. Quicklook may not be
sufficient for some checkins. Consult your module owner/tech lead if
necessary. These are the regression tests:
    <ul>
      <li>Quicklook tests (minimum for all check-ins) </li>
      <li>Developer unit tests (strongly encouraged, required for some
teams) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Include the following information in the commit message:
    <ul>
      <li>Description (and bugid if it's a bug fix) </li>
      <li>Code reviewer(s) </li>
      <li>Which tests have been run </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure there is sufficient test coverage for your change.
Consider running the developer unit tests. Is the appropriate SQE
engineer
aware of this change? </li>
  <li>If it's a new feature or there is documentation impact, please
send email
to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the documentation team.</span>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Soft Code Freeze Period</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The goal is to fix all bugs scheduled to be fixed for the release
(P1 and P2&nbsp; bugs). Bugs can also be waived by the project leader
if
the issue is
too risky to fix. </li>
  <li>No new features are allowed unless they are explicitly approved
by the project leader<br>
  </li>
  <li>All check-ins must be reviewed and approved fellow developer or
module owner<br>
  </li>
  <li>Integrations (ORB, JAX*, MQ, etc.) must be approved by
the
project lead, send email to <a href="mailto:dev@glassfish.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish.dev.java.net.</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hard Code Freeze Period</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This period is for "surprises" only. All known bugs should have
been fixed in the soft code freeze period.</li>
  <li>To have a bug considered for inclusion to the release send email
to <a href="mailto:dev@glassfish.dev.java.net">dev@glassfish.dev.java.net</a>
with the word ShowStopper in the subject line<br>
  </li>
  <li>Follow the same steps as the soft code freeze but only
showstopper bugs will be addressed</li>
  <li>Any check-in has to be approved by the project leader in addition
to
code review</li>
  <li>The project leader will respond daily with a list of approved bug
fixes and waived
bugs
(defer until next release)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Checklist for Code Reviewers</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Are you the right reviewer?</li>
  <li>Can you review the code within 1 business day? (Can you find a
delegate if not?)</li>
  <li>Is there a bug filed (if it's a bug fix)?</li>
  <li>Is there sufficient test coverage for the change?</li>
  <li>Are there enough comments in the code to understand the change?</li>
  <li>Is the code I18N compliant?</li>
  <li>Are there log messages for any errors? Do they have message IDs?
Are they at the right level? Are they self-explanatory (i.e. not
cryptic)? Does the log message have a serious performance impact?</li>
  <li>Is the code formatted with the same format as the rest of the
code in the file? Are the Java coding conventions followed?</li>
  <li>Is the design sound? Does it fit in with the design of the rest
of the module? Is it robust enough?</li>
  <li>Are there other related areas that need to be investigated that
might need a similar fix?<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Checklist for Code Submitters</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Is there a bug filed (if it's a bug fix)?</li>
  <li>Has the code been reviewed?</li>
  <li>Have you run all appropriate regression tests?</li>
  <li>Has information about the change been sent to the documentation
writers and testers?</li>
  <li>Is there sufficient test coverage for the change? Should new unit
tests be written?</li>
  <li>Has your workspace been updated recently? Are you using the right
branch? Have you checked and resolved all CVS conflicts? </li>
  <li>Are there enough comments in the code to understand the change?</li>
  <li>Is the code I18N compliant?</li>
  <li>Are there log messages for any errors? Do they have message IDs?
Are they at the right level? Are they self-explanatory (i.e. not
cryptic)? Does this log message have a serious performance impact?</li>
  <li>Is the code formatted with the same format as the rest of the
code in the file? Are the Java coding conventions followed?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Checklist for Post-review/Check-in</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Did you incorporate all the changes requested and get them
reviewed?</li>
  <li>Did you add all of the new files to the repository?</li>
  <li>Did you update, recompile, and run the appropriate tests?</li>
  <li>Did you check in all the changes together and make sure your
check-in comment
contains a description, a reviewer, and the tests run? If the change
spans
multiple areas, it is recommended to include the list of changed files
into the log message as well.</li>
  <li>If the change is a bug fix, update the issue in Bugtraq to <code>integrated</code>
along with a pointer to
the unit or Quicklook test that covers the bug.</li>
  <li>Notify testing, documentation, and any other groups of your
change if it affects user functionality or a bug that was blocking them.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="Quicklook_Tests"></a>Quicklook Tests</h3>
<p>Quicklook tests are breadth tests with high-level coverage of many
functions in the
Application Server. They are meant to give the developer a way
of testing major functionality in the Application Server and of running
a sanity check to ensure that nothing major is broken.</p>
<p>To run the Quicklook tests:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install GlassFish or get the server image (${glassfish.home})
bootstrapped using <code>maven bootstrap,</code> Refer to <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/BuildGlassFish.html">Build
instructions</a><br>
  </li>
  <li>Checkout the Quicklook tests: Once you have glassfish/bootstrap
module checked out in above step, checkout Quicklook tests using
"checkout-quicklook" maven goal to just checkout few required files for
running quicklook tests instead of whole appserv-tests module.</li>
  <pre>cd workspace (directory where you have the server code)<br>cd glassfish/bootstrap<br>maven checkout-quicklook<br></pre>
If you want to checkout all the tests including Developers Tests, do
the following.<br>
  <pre>cvs -d :pserver:&lt;userid&gt;@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs checkout glassfish/appserv-tests<br></pre>
  <li>Environment settings and permissions:
    <ul>
      <li>Set the proper environment variables in your <code>.cshrc</code>,
or <code>.bat</code> file:</li>
      <li>Set <code>APS_HOME</code>. This is the directory where you
checked out the
workspace including the workspace root name (e.g. <code>/workspace/appserv-tests</code>)</li>
      <li>Set <code>S1AS_HOME</code>. This is installation directory
for the Application Server (e.g. <code>/Sun/Appserver</code>)</li>
      <li>Set <code>JAVA_HOME</code>. This is directory where you
installed JDK 5 (e.g. <code>/Sun/jdk1.5.0_06</code>)</li>
      <li>Set <code>MAVEN_HOME</code>. This is installation directory
for Maven 1.0.2 (e.g. <code>/workspace/maven-1.0.2</code>). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>On Unix:</p>
    <pre>setenv PATH $S1AS_HOME/bin;$JAVA_HOME/bin;$MAVEN_HOME/bin;$PATH<br></pre>
    <p>On Windows:</p>
    <pre>set PATH=%S1AS_HOME%/bin;%JAVA_HOME%/bin;%MAVEN_HOME%/bin;%PATH%<br></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Modify the installation
properties under <code>${APS_HOME}/config.properties</code> to match
your installation (e.g. <code>admin.password</code>, <code>http.port</code>,
etc.)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quicklook</span>:
Run the test on Single instance Domain on Domain Admin Server
(domain1).
    <pre>% cd $APS_HOME<br>% maven runtest</pre>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Quicklook for Cluster mode</span>:
Run the test on Cluster mode Domain (which is created by using "maven
configure-cluster"). This will run test on Remote instance sqe-server,
created and managed by nodeagent, sqe-agent that will be automatically
created by the following target.
    <pre>% cd $APS_HOME<br>% maven runtest-ee-standalone</pre>
To run both Quicklook types above to verify your changes for all
server combinations, use following command (which may take longer since
its going to run the tests on both, domain1 and sqe-server as above)
    <pre>% cd $APS_HOME<br>% maven runtest-ee</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Open the <code>${APS_HOME}/test_results.html</code> file in a
browser and examine the results.</li>
  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The default target for any <code>build.xml</code> file is <code>usage</code>.
Running <code>% ant</code>
shows a list of modules you may execute independently.</li>
    <li>The <code>runtest</code> target specified above starts a
GlassFish Server
instance, starts Derby, and creates a summary report.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Confirm the test count and details:</li>

<h3><a name="Submit_a_Patch"></a>Submit a Patch</h3>
<p><!--?? Do we want to ask for a test case??<br>

?? pointer to the agreement that they need to sign??<br>-->
</p>
<p>Well-described, easy-to-apply patches are a pleasure for other
developers to encounter
and go a long way towards making the module or component more stable
and powerful.&nbsp; The first step to submitting a patch is to sign and
return <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/SCA_June05.pdf">Sun's
Contributor Agreement.</a>&nbsp; Please print this form out,
fill in all the necessary detail, and return it <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/GovernancePolicy.html#SCA_Policy">here.</a><br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>If you are not yet a member of GlassFish</strong> but you
have mailing list access, you can post a message
about your proposed patch to the project's developer mailing list.
(Read more about <a
 href="https://www.dev.java.net/nonav/scdocs/ProjectMail.html#mailsubscribe">subscribing
to project mailing lists</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>If you are a GlassFish member</strong>,
first conduct a query of the <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">GlassFish
issue database</a> to determine
whether this patch is associated with an already reported defect.</li>
  <li>Also check<a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/index.jsp">
web bugs&nbsp; </a>under category "Sun Java System Application Server/
J2EE SDK"<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>If your patch pertains to an existing issue, you should use the <code>Create
a new attachment</code> link in the issue edit screen to submit your
patch and the <code>Add Comment</code>
section to post an explanatory message. (Remember that changes to
issues generate automatic email messages to the issue's owner and
anyone on the cc list. All those people will receive your message
and a link to your patch.)</p>
<p>If an issue <em>does not</em> exist, submit your patch as a new
issue, using the <code>Patch</code> link in the <code>Enter An Issue</code>
section of
the <code>Issue Tracking</code> page.&nbsp; Note that you will need to
update your workspace to use the latest sources, rebuild the glassfish
server and we strongly encourage you to run the <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/GuidelinesandConventions.html#Quicklook_Tests">Quicklook
tests </a>to
check that nothing is broken.&nbsp; Then attach your patch file to the
new
issue as described here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, make sure you are making changes in the most recent
version of the
source files -- for this, it is best to use CVS to check out the source
(on the CVS trunk), make your modifications (but do not check them in),
and then run the command:</p>
    <p><code>cvs diff -c &gt; mypatch</code></p>
    <p>to get a context-format patch for the sources. This gives you a
patch
file which includes information about the version you are patching, the
filenames, and the contents of the change. This is the preferred way to
keep track of patches and makes it easier for others to find and test
your patch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To apply a patch, go to the proper directory and run:</p>
    <p><code>patch &lt; issuepatch.diff</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Always include a message with your patch with the following
information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A description of what problem or defect you are attempting to
fix, and the steps to reproduce it, if possible.</li>
      <li>A description of what the behavior should be with the patch
in place.</li>
      <li>A description of how the patch works, if reasonable. If a
significant
amount of code is involved, include within the message that you agree
to let the patch be used under the applicable project license as part
of the IDE's code.</li>
      <li>A testcase including the jave source, scripts and
documentation so we may include this test in the appserv-test/devtests
testsuite.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The developer responsible for the section of code affected should
either
apply the patch and mark the defect (if there is one registered) as
fixed, or reply with an objection if it does not seem safe, does not
appear to fix the problem, or there is not really a problem to begin
with. Notifications of any changes to the issues database, as well as
CVS check-ins, are automatically sent to the appropriate issue
assignee and cc'd to the CVS mailing lists, so you can monitor whether
the
patch has been applied. Be sure to subscribe to at least the CVS and
issue mailing lists for the project you are working on.</p>
<p>If you do not know exactly how to fix a problem, but have an idea
about
what is causing it, you can post a message about this on the developer
discussion list for other project members' suggestions or to find
someone who knows how to fix it.</p>
