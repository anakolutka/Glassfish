DESCRIPTION
     The create-jmsdest command creates a JMS  physical  destina-
     tion.  Along  with  the  physical  destination,  you use the
     create-jms-resource command  to  create  a  JMS  destination
     resource  that has a Name property that specifies the physi-
     cal destination. This command is supported  in  remote  mode
     only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP/S port for administration. This is the port  to
         which  you  should point your browser in order to manage
         the domain. For example, http://localhost:4848.

Administration Commands                         create-jmsdest(1)

         The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user
         The authorized domain administration server  administra-
         tive username.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login  command,  then  you  need  not specify the --user
         option  on  subsequent  operations  to  this  particular
         domain.

     --passwordfile

         The --passwordfile option specifies the name,  including
         the full path, of a file containing the password entries
         in a specific format. The entry for  the  password  must
         have  the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the password name
         in uppercase letters.

         For example, to specify the domain administration server
         password,  use  an  entry  with  the  following  format:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password, where password is the actual
         administrator  password.  Other  passwords  that  can be
         specified        include        AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, and AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

         All remote commands must specify the admin  password  to
         authenticate to the domain administration server, either
         through --passwordfile or  asadmin  login,  or  interac-
         tively  on the command prompt. The asadmin login command
         can be used only to  specify  the  admin  password.  For
         other  passwords, that must be specified for remote com-
         mands, use the --passwordfile or enter them at the  com-
         mand prompt.

         If you have authenticated to a domain using the  asadmin
         login command, then you need not specify the admin pass-
         word through the  --passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
         operations  to  this particular domain. However, this is
         applicable only to AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.  You  will
         still  need to provide the other passwords, for example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as and when required  by  indivi-
         dual commands, such as update-file-user.

         For  security  reasons,  passwords   specified   as   an

         environment variable will not be read by asadmin.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         This option helps specify the target for which  you  are
         creating  the physical destination. Although the create-
         jmsdest command is related to resources, a physical des-
         tination  is created using the JMS Service (JMS Broker),
         which is part of the configuration. A JMS Broker is con-
         figured  in  the  config  section  of  domain.xml. Valid
         values are:

             o    server- Specifies the default  server  instance
                  as  target  for  creating the physical destina-
                  tion. server is the name of the default  server
                  instance.  server  is the default value of this
                  option .

             o    configuration_name- Specifies a particular con-
                  figuration  as the target for creating the phy-
                  sical destination.

             o    cluster_name- Specifies  a  certain  cluster  ,
                  such  as cluster1, as a target for creating the
                  physical destination. The JMS physical destina-
                  tion is created on every server instance in the
                  cluster.

             o    instance_name- Specifies  a  particular  server
                  instance  as a target for creating the physical
                  destination.
         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created
         with the cluster profile or the enterprise profile.

     -T--desttype

         The type of the JMS destination. Valid values are  topic
         and queue.

     --property
         Optional attribute name/value pairs for configuring  the

Administration Commands                         create-jmsdest(1)

         physical destination. You can specify the following pro-
         perty for a physical destination:

         maxNumActiveConsumers

             The maximum number of consumers that can  be  active
             in  load-balanced delivery from a queue destination.
             A value  of  -1  means  an  unlimited  number.   The
             default is 1.

         To modify the value of this property or to specify other
         physical     destination     properties,     use     the
         install_dir/imq/bin/imqcmd command.

OPERANDS
     dest_name                   A unique identifier for the  JMS
                                 destination to be created.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-jmsdest command

     The following command creates a  JMS  physical  queue  named
     PhysicalQueue.

       asadmin> create-jmsdest --user admin
       --passwordfile passwords.txt --host localhost --port 4848 --desttype queue
       --property User=public:Password=public PhysicalQueue
       Command create-jmsdest executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
