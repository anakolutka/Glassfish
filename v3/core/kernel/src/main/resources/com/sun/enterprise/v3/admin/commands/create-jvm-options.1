Administration Commands                     create-jvm-options(1)

NAME
     create-jvm-options - creates JVM options in the Java  confi-
     guration or profiler element of the domain.xml file.

SYNOPSIS
     create-jvm-options
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target]
     [--profiler={true|false}] (jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value)
     [:jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value*]

DESCRIPTION
     The create-jvm-options command creates command-line  options
     that  are  passed  to  the  JavaTM application launcher when
     Enterprise Server is started. These options  are  stored  in
     the  Java  configuration  element or profiler element of the
     domain.xml file. If options are created for a profiler, they
     are used to record the settings that are required to start a
     particular profiler.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

     The  create-jvm-options  command   creates   the   following
     options:

         o    Java system properties. System properties  are  set
              through  the  -D  option  of  the  Java application
              launcher, for example:

             o    -Djava.security.manager

             o    -Denvironment=Production

         o    Startup parameters for the Virtual Machine for  the
              Java   platform  (Java  Virtual  Machine  or  JVMTM
              machine).

         The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean  a  Vir-
         tual  Machine  for  the Java platform.Startup parameters
         are preceded by the dash character (-) , for example:

             o    --XX:PermSize=size

             o    -Xmx1024m

Administration Commands                     create-jvm-options(1)

             o    -client

             o    -d64

     In the following situations, you must terminate the  command
     with a double-dash (--) before the options:

         o    You are specifying only one  system  property  with
              just   a   name   and   no   value,   for  example,
              -Djava.security.manager.

         o    You are specifying a startup parameter for the  JVM
              machine without a value, for example, -Xmx1024m

     Note -

       If the command specifies an option  that  already  exists,
       the command does not re-create the option.

     For newly created options to take effect, you  must  restart
     the  domain administration server (DAS). To restart the DAS,
     use the following commands in this order:

         1.   stop-domain(1)

         2.   start-domain(1)

     For more information about the  Java  application  launcher,
     see the reference page for the operating system that you are
     using:

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on

         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile
         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

Administration Commands                     create-jvm-options(1)

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

Administration Commands                     create-jvm-options(1)

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the JVM options are for the  profiler.
         The  profiler  must  exist  for  this option to be true.
         Default is false.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name
         The left side of the equal sign (=) is  the  JVM  option
         name.  The  right  side of the equal sign (=) is the JVM
         option value. A colon (:) is a  delimiter  for  multiple
         options.

         Note -

           If an option name or option value  contains  a  colon,
           the  backslash  (\fR) must be used to escape the colon
           in the name or value.   Other  characters  might  also
           require  an  escape  character.  For  more information
           about escape characters in command  options,  see  the
           asadmin(1M) man page.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Setting Java System Properties

     JVM machine options must start with  a  dash  (-).  Use  the
     backslash (\fR) to escape the dash delimiter.

     Example 2 Setting a Single Startup  Parameter  for  the  JVM
     Machine

     This example shows  the  command  for  setting  the  maximum
     available heap size to 1024. Because this command is setting
     a startup parameter for the JVM machine without a value, the

     command is terminated by a double dash -- before the parame-
     ter.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options -- -Xmx1024m
       created 1 option(s)

       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

     Example 3 Setting Multiple Startup Parameters  for  the  JVM
     Machine

     This example shows the command for setting  startup  parame-
     ters for the JVM machine as follows:

         o    The maximum available heap size is set to 1024.

         o    Information about garbage collection is to be  pro-
              vided.

       asadmin> create-jvm-options "-Xmx1024m:-XX:+PrintGCDetails"
       created 1 option(s)

       Command create-jvm-options executed successfully.

     In this example, one parameter already  existed  before  the
     command  was  run.  Therefore, the command reports that only
     one option was set.

EXIT STATUS
