User Commands                                            unset(1)

NAME
     unset - removes one or more  variables  from  the  multimode
     environment

SYNOPSIS
     unset [name [name]*]

DESCRIPTION
     The unset command removes one or more variables you set  for
     the  multimode  environment. The variables and their associ-
     ated values will no longer exist in the environment.

OPERANDS
     name            Environment variable to be removed.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using unset to remove environment variables

     asadmin> export AS_ADMIN_HOST=bluestar AS_ADMIN_PORT=8000 AS_ADMIN_USER=admin
     asadmin> export AS_ADMIN_PREFIX=server1.jms-service
     asadmin> export
     AS_ADMIN_USER = admin
     AS_ADMIN_HOST = bluestar
     AS_ADMIN_PREFIX = server1.jms-service
     AS_ADMIN_PORT = 8000
     asadmin> unset AS_ADMIN_PREFIX
     asadmin> export
     AS_ADMIN_USER = admin
     AS_ADMIN_HOST = bluestar
     AS_ADMIN_PORT = 8000

     Using the export command  without  the  argument  lists  the
     environment    variables    that   are   set.   Notice   the
     AS_ADMIN_PREFIX is not in the environment after running  the
     unset command.

EXIT STATUS
     0               command executed successfully

     1               error in executing the command
