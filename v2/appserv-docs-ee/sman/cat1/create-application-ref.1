NAME
     create-application-ref - creates a reference to an  applica-
     tion

SYNOPSIS
     create-application-ref  --user  admin_user   [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--target    target]    [--enabled=true]   [--virtualservers
     virtual_servers] reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The create-application-ref command creates a reference  from
     a  cluster or an unclustered server instance to a previously
     deployed application element (for example, a Java EE  appli-
     cation,  a  Web  module, or an enterprise bean module). This
     effectively  results  in  the  application   element   being
     deployed  and  made  available  on  the targeted instance or
     cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they  will  receive
     the new application element the next time they start.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:

                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                Specifies the target for  which  you
                             are  creating the application refer-
                             ence. Valid values are

                               o  server,   which   creates   the
                                  application  reference  for the
                                  default server instance  server
                                  and is the default value

                               o  cluster_name, which creates the
                                  application reference for every
                                  server instance in the cluster

                               o  instance_name,  which   creates
                                  the  application  reference for
                                  the  named  unclustered  server
                                  instance

     --enabled               Indicates  whether  the  application
                             should be enabled (that is, loaded).
                             This value will take effect only  if
                             the  application  is  enabled at the
                             global level. The default is true.

     --virtualservers        Comma-separated  list   of   virtual
                             server IDs on which to deploy.  This
                             option applies only to  Web  modules
                             (either  standalone  or in a Java EE
                             application). If this option is  not
                             specified,    the   application   is
                             deployed  to  all  virtual   servers
                             except  the  administrative  server,
                             __asadmin.

OPERANDS
