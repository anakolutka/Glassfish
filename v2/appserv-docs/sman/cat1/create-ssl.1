DESCRIPTION
     Creates and configures the SSL element in the selected  HTTP
     listener,  IIOP  listener,  or IIOP service to enable secure
     communication on that listener/service.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     preceeds  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin

                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                In Enterprise Edition, specifies the
                             target  on which you are configuring
                             the  ssl  element.   The   following
                             values are valid:

                               o  server, the server in which the
                                  iiop-service    or    HTTP/IIOP
                                  listener is  to  be  configured
                                  for SSL.

                               o  config, the configuration  that
                                  contains the HTTP/IIOP listener
                                  or iiop-service for  which  SSL
                                  is to be configured.

                               o  cluster, the cluster  in  which
                                  the   HTTP/IIOP   listener   or

                                  iiop-service is to  be  config-
                                  ured  for  SSL.  All the server
                                  instances in the  cluster  will
                                  get  the  SSL configuration for
                                  the  respective   listener   or
                                  iiop-service.

                               o  instance, the instance in which
                                  the   HTTP/IIOP   listener   or
                                  iiop-service is to  be  config-
                                  ured for SSL.

OPTIONAL ATTRIBUTES
     The following optional attribute name/value pairs are avail-
     able:

     _______________________________________________________________________
       Property             Definition
      type                  The type of service or listener  for
                            which  the  SSL is created. The type
                            can be http-listener, iiop-listener,
                            or  iiop-service.  When  the type is
                            iiop-service, the  ssl-client-config
                            along  with the embedded ssl element
                            is created in domain.xml.
      certname              The nickname of the server  certifi-
                            cate  in the certificate database or
                            the PKCS#11 token. The format of the
                            name    in    the   certificate   is
                            tokenname:nickname.  For  this  pro-
                            perty, the tokenname: is optional.
      ssl2enabled           Set this property to true to  enable
                            SSL2. The default value is false. If
                            both SSL2 and SSL3 are enabled for a
                            virtual  server,  the  server  tries
                            SSL3 encryption first. In the  event
                            SSL3  encryption  fails,  the server
                            then tries SSL2 encryption.
      ssl2ciphers           A comma-separated list of  the  SSL2
                            ciphers to be used. Use the prefix +
                            to enable or - to disable a particu-
                            lar cipher. Allowed values are: rc4,
                            rc4export,  rc2,  rc2export,   idea,
                            des,  and  desede3.  If  no value is
                            specified, all supported ciphers are
                            assumed to be enabled.

      ssl3enabled           Set this property to false  to  dis-
                            able  SSL3.  The  default  value  is
                            true. If  both  SSL2  and  SSL3  are
                            enabled  for  a  virtual server, the
                            server tries SSL3 encryption  first.
                            In  the event SSL3 encryption fails,
                            the server then tries  SSL2  encryp-
                            tion.
      tlsenabled            Set this property to false  to  dis-
                            able  TLS. The default value is true
                            It is good practice to  enable  TLS,
                            which  is  a  more secure version of
                            SSL.
      ssl3tlsciphers        A comma-separated list of  the  SSL3
                            and/or  TLS  ciphers to be used. Use
                            the prefix + to enable or - to  dis-
                            able  a  particular  cipher. Allowed
                            values are SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5,
                            SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,     ,
                            SSL_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA,
    |                       SSL_RSA_EXPORT_WITH_RC4_40_MD5,                |
    |                       SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_MD5,SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,|
    |                       and   SSL_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA.  If  no           |
    |                       value is  specified,  all  supported           |
    |                       ciphers are assumed to be enabled.             |
    | tlsrollbackenabled    Set to true (default) to enable  TLS           |
    |                       rollback.  TLS  rollback  should  be           |
    |                       enabled   for   Microsoft   Internet           |
    |                       Explorer 5.0 and 5.5. This option is           |
    |                       only valid in  the  Enterprise  Edi-           |
    |                       tion. This option is only valid when           |
    |                       tlsenabled=true.                               |
    | clientauthenabled     Set to true if you want  SSL3 client           |
    |                       authentication  performed  on  every           |
    |                       request  independent  of   ACL-based           |
    |                       access  control.  Default  value  is           |
    |                       false.                                         |
    |______________________________________________________________________|

OPERANDS
     listener_id              The ID of the HTTP or IIOP listener
                             for  which  the SSL element is to be
                             created.  The  listener_id  is   not
                             required  if  the  --type  is  iiop-
                             service.
