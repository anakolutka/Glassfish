SYNOPSIS
     create-connector-resource
     [--help]
      [--target target]

DESCRIPTION
     This command registers the connector resource with the  JNDI
     name, which is specified by the jndi_name operand.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --poolname

         The name of  the  connection  pool.  When  two  or  more
         resource elements point to the same connection pool ele-
         ment, they use the same pool connections at runtime.

     --enabled
         This option determines whether the resource  is  enabled
         at runtime. The default value is true.

     --description

         Text providing details about the connector resource.

     --property
         Optional attribute name value pairs for configuring  the
         resource.
