Welcome to the Deployment page where you can find an overview of
deployment's design, implementation, and testing as well as general
discussion about the component.
<p>Deployment is the process by which administrators and developers
place applications into service within the app server (as in &#8220;The
deployment of my new application worked!&#8221;). Within the GlassFish
project the term &#8220;deployment&#8221; also refers to the code itself that
accomplishes this (as in &#8220;I am starting to read through the deployment
code.&#8221;) You will see further distinctions as you explore the process
and the code in more detail. </p>
<p>The main purpose of this page is to give you an overall view of how
the deployment component is built and to let you know where in the
codebase to look for the details of a particular part of deployment. We
hope to add more information over time but hope that this gives you a
good start if you are interested in learning about deployment and its
implementation.</p>
<h3>Deployment News</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the latest work on deployment has involved annotations
and dependency injection, new features in Java EE 5. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning with the GlassFish implementation, remote tools such
as user-written deployers do not depend on the large appserv-rt.jar
library. Instead, you can run such tools with only the smaller
appserv-deployment-client.jar, appserv-ext.jar, javaee.jar, and
jmx-remote-opt.jar library jar files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the GlassFish project implements Java EE 5, users can
build and deploy applications that have <b><i>no </i></b>deployment
descriptors!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a name="RemoteJMXMessaging"></a><a name="DeploymentFacility"></a>
Each deployment client communicates with the server using remote JMX
messages. The DeploymentFacility component provides an easy-to-use
internal API for performing common deployment tasks, relieving the
clients themselves from the details of exchanging JMX messaging with
the back-end. All deployment clients use the DeploymentFacility.</p>
<p><a name="ServerSide"></a><a name="DeploymentService"></a>On the
server side, the admin infrastructure receives and interprets the
incoming JMX messages and invokes the appropriate method on the
DeploymentService (an interface). The PEDeploymentService class
implements this interface and responds to each incoming JMX message
that related to deployment. It executes the <a
 href="#0.0.0.0.Back-end%20Deployment%20Phases%7Coutline">phases</a>
that should run for each operation, delegating work to the deployer
class tailored to the particular type of module involved in the
operation (enterprise app, web app, app client, etc.).</p>

<h4><a name="0.0.0.0.Packaging Applications for Deployment|outline"></a><a
 name="0.0.0.0.Packaging Applications for Deployment|outline"></a>
Packaging Applications for Deployment</h4>
<p>The Java EE and other related specifications describe how archives
should be assembled (such as an .ear for an enterprise app, a .war for
a Web app, etc.) for deployment to compliant app servers. The GlassFish
project honors those formats but also provides for <b>directory
deployment</b>, in which users prepare a properly-structured directory
which organizes the files that would otherwise be inside an archive.
Although an expanded directory like this is more cumbersome to move
from one place to another, using directory deployment might be a
particularly good approach for certain situations, particularly IDEs.
Using directory deployment saves the IDE from having to construct the
archive file from the input files, and the app server itself does not
need to go through the step of expanding the archive file into its own
directory.</p>
<p>One way to understand the directory structure that GlassFish expects
is to deploy an application you have packaged as an archive and then
look at the directory the app server creates for that application in
the app server's <i>install-path</i>/domains/<i>domain-name</i>/applications
directory. You will find subdirectories for j2ee-apps (containing a
directory for each deployed enterprise app) and j2ee-modules
(containing a directory for each deployed Web app). (Note that you
should not change the contents of these directories or otherwise depend
on their structure. The layout and contents of these directories is
private to the GlassFish implementation and could change between
releases.)</p>
<p style="font-style: normal;">The general structure of these
directories is fairly straightforward. The directory should contain
whatever files you would otherwise have included in the archive &#8211; in
the correct subdirectory &#8211; with the exception that any embedded
archives (such as a Web app or an application client embedded inside an
.ear file) must themselves be expanded. The name of the subdirectory
for such sub-modules should be the file name of the archive with the
&#8220;.&#8221; that separates the name from the type replaced with an underscore
(&#8220;_&#8221;). For example, suppose an enterprise app contains an embedded Web
app that would normally be packaged inside the .ear archive as
myWebApp.war. A directory structure that could be used for directory
deployment might look something like this:</p>
<pre><i>top-level-directory</i>
    META-INF
        application.xml
        Manifest.xml
    myWebApp_war
        index.jsp
        META-INF
            Manifest.mf
        WEB-INF
            classes
                MyClass.class</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> <br>
</p>
<p>Note how the contents of the myWebApp_war subdirectory mirrors the
contents you would expect to find in the corresponding Web application
archive file.</p>
<p>If you prepare a directory according to these naming conventions,
you can use it for directory deployment.</p>
<h4><a name="JSR88"></a><a name="0.0.0.0.JSR-88 Implementation|outline"></a>
JSR-88 Implementation</h4>
<p>The GlassFish project includes an implementation of the JSR-88 API.
This allows any tool that complies with JSR-88 to deploy applications
to and undeploy applications from the app server. </p>
<p>The JSR-88 implementation in the GlassFish project exposes several
classes to the tool writer. One of the main ones is the
SunDeploymentManager which implements the JSR-88 DeploymentManager
interface. It bridges the JSR-88 API to the DeploymentFacility shared
by all GlassFish project deployment clients. If you are interested in
exploring the JSR-88 implementation, this class is a good place to
start. It and other classes related to the JSR-88 implementation reside
in the appserv-core/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/deployapi branch of the
source code repository.</p>
<h4><a name="0.0.0.0.Back-end Deployment Phases|outline"></a><a
 name="0.0.0.0.Back-end Deployment Phases|outline"></a> Back-end
Deployment Phases</h4>
<p>On the server side, deployment is implemented as a sequence of
phases. Each phase tracks the changes it makes in the app server's data
structures and directories so it can roll back those changes in case of
an error during deployment. The classes in <br>
<br>
appserv-core/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/deployment/phasing <br>
<br>
implement this phased behavior. This table gives an overview of the
phases and their general responsibilities. Consult the source code for
further details.</p>

<h4>Unit/Acceptance Tests</h4>
<p>In addition to running the project-wide QuickLook tests required
before any check-in, you should also run the deployment unit tests.
Consult the README file in <a
