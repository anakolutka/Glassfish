    <name>Maven extension for building GlassFish</name>
    <description>
        GlassFish build depends on properly functioning several custom lifecycle mappings and
        artifact handlers. Because these are necessary to resolve dependencies and to run
        "gf:run" goal and etc., it is critical that these extensions be made available to
        Maven early on during Maven execution.

        This definition was originally in maven-glassfish-plugin, which was integrated
        into Maven POM through &lt;plugin>/&lt;extensions>true marking, but after
        a series of debugging to resolve artifact resolution failure problems, it turns
        out that that doesn't cause Maven to load components early enough.

        I tried to circumbent the prolem by also registering the maven-glassfish-plugin
        as an extension module (via &lt;build>/&lt;extensions/&lt;extension>), but that
        apparently confuses Maven to no end --- I get build errors like this:

          [INFO] Internal error in the plugin manager executing goal 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jar-plugin:2.1:jar': Unable to find the mojo 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jar-plugin:2.1:jar' in the plugin 'org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-jar-plugin'

        This is obviously one of the problematic areas of Maven, so to avoid doing hack
        over hack, I'm simply moving the component definitions to its own module.
