DESCRIPTION
     The deploy-jbi-service-assembly command  deploys  a  service
     assembly into the JBI environment.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the

                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --enabled               If this option is set to  true,  the
                             service assembly is started automat-
                             ically when the  system  starts  up.
                             Users are allowed to access the ser-
                             vice assembly. If this option is set
                             to  false,  the  service assembly is
                             not started automatically  when  the
                             system starts up. Users are not able
                             to access the service assembly.  For
                             EE,  this option enables the deploy-
                             ment   on   the   specified   target
                             instance  or cluster. This option is
                             ignored when the service assembly is
                             being deployed on the target domain.

     --upload                When this option is set to true, the
                             command  uploads  the  file  to  the
                             administration server. The  file  is
                             uploaded to the $JBI_HOME/tmp direc-
                             tory on  the  Domain  Administration
                             Server     (DAS),    for    example,
                             $AS_INSTALL_DIR/domains/domain_name/jbi/tmp.
                             If  the  filepath of the installable
                             file  is  mounted  to   the   server
                             machine,  or  if  the administration

                             server is running locally,  set  the
                             upload option to false.

     --target                Specifies the target  on  which  you
                             are  deploying the service assembly.
                             Specify this option only if the ser-
                             vice  assembly is deployed in a mul-
                             tiserver environment with a DAS.  If
                             the service assembly is not deployed
                             in a multiserver environment with  a
                             DAS,  this  option is ignored. Valid
                             values are:

                               o  server, which deploys  the  JBI
                                  service  assembly on the embed-
                                  ded DAS instance. This  is  the
                                  default value.

                               o  domain, which deploys  the  JBI
                                  service assembly for the admin-
                                  istrative    domain     itself.
                                  Specify  domain only if you are
                                  using the cluster profile.

                               o  cluster_name, which deploys the
                                  JBI  service  assembly on every
                                  server instance in the cluster.

                               o  instance_name,  which   deploys
                                  the  JBI  service  assembly for
                                  the  named  unclustered  server
                                  instance.

OPERANDS
     filepath or service_assembly_name

         The path to the archive file that  contains  the  attri-
         butes  of  the  JBI  service assembly or the name of the
         service assembly that has been  previously  deployed  to
         the domain.
