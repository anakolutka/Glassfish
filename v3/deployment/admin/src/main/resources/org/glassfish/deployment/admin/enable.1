NAME
     enable - enables the component

SYNOPSIS
     enable
     [--help]
     [ --target  target_name]
     [component_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The enable command enables the specified component.  If  the
     component  is  already  enabled,  then it is re-enabled. The
     component must have been deployed in order to be enabled. If
     it has not been deployed, then an error message is returned.
     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     component_name              name  of  the  component  to  be
                                 enabled.
