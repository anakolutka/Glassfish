Addon is a companion product or runtime component installed on top of Sun Java 
System Application Server. The runtime of the addon typically is embedded
in the application server JVM as a Lifecycle module. An addon might
also use one or more Java EE applications for managing its' runtime.
An addon is free to use its own workspace, shared libraries, configuration
files or any mechanism needed to setup its' runtime. 
<p>
An addon package is
implemented as two plugins called Installer plugin and configurator plugin for
installation and configuration respectively. 

To enable the components code their implementation, the addon infrastructure API is
made available as a maven repository.

The component teams implement the above API to develop installer and configurator plugins.
Once the addon is installed and configured, it'll be
possible to unconfigure per domain or across all domains. It is also possible to
upgrade the configurator to a new version as discussed below. Since the upgrade 
is detected using the naming convention for the addon jar file name, it is critical 
that the naming convention is adhered to.
<p>
At present, it is possible to install/configure the addon at the domain level and
in future this may be extended to server instances.
<p>

<h2>Installer Plugin</h2>
<p>
If addon requires installation of shared files which are not specific to a 
particular application server domain, installation and initial configuration 
of such files must be handled by installer plugin. Installer plugin is an 
implementation of <code>com.sun.appserv.addons.Installer</code> interface. The 
installer plugin has read-write access to installation root directory 
(INSTALL_ROOT) of the appserver. 
<p>
Installer plugin is invoked either at the end of appserver installation or when 
the CLI command <code>asadmin install-addon addon_name_installer.jar</code>
is executed.
<p>
As part of installation, the installer plugin should ensure that a configurator jar file 
representing the run time component is made available in 
INSTALL_ROOT/lib/addons. This jar file, called configurator plugin is used to 
configure the domain. 
<p>
The installer plugin will get executed only in the DAS (Domain Administration 
Server) installation. 
<p>
The installer plugin is also used to uninstall the addon. Uninstallation
is triggered either at the beginning of appserver uninstallation or when 
<code>asadmin uninstall-addon addon_name</code> CLI command is executed.

<h3>Packaging Guidelines for Installer Plugin</h3>

The installer plugin for an addon must be packaged in a jar file named 
<code>addon_name_installer.jar</code>, where addon_name is the name of the addon.
The <code>META-INF/services/com.sun.appserv.addons.Installer</code> file in the 
installer plugin jar will contain the name of the addon installer 
implementation class.

<h2>Configurator Plugin</h2>

Configurator plugin is an implementation of 
<code>com.sun.appserv.addons.Configurator</code> interface. It will be placed
in the INSTALL_ROOT/lib/addons by the installer plugin. Configuration plugin 
will be invoked always in the DAS installation. It will get invoked before DAS 
is started and before a command that start the remote instance is executed.
<p>
The configurator plugin should assume read-only access to INSTALL_ROOT and 
read-write access to root directory of the domain (DOMAIN_DIR). The configurator
will be invoked once, prior to starting application server domain. 
The configurator will access application server configuration files like 
DOMAIN_DIR/config/domain.xml, DOMAIN_DIR/config/server.policy etc. and make 
ncessary changes. While making such changes, configurator plugin is expected to
use the addons directory in the INSTANCE_ROOT to refer the shared files.
<p>
If an addon require a working directory where it need to store the configuraton
files or any data, addon runtime can create it when required. It is recommended 
for the addon to create such directories under INSTANCE_ROOT/addons/<addon_name>

<h3>Packaging Guidelines for Configurator Plugin</h3>

The configurator plugin for an addon must be packaged in a jar file named 
<code>addon_name_configurator.jar</code>, where addon_name is the name of the addon.
The <code>META-INF/services/com.sun.appserv.addons.Configurator</code> file of the 
configurator plugin jar will contain the name of the addon configurator 
implementation class.

<h3>Addon Registry</h3>

Appserver will maintain a properties file <code>domain-registry</code> in the 
INSTANCE_ROOT/config directory. This registry will conatin the state of the 
addon. The registry will contain information about the state of the addon 
similar to what is shown below.

<pre>
addon_name_configurator_01_01_00.configured=true
addon_name_configurator_01_01_00.enabled=true
</pre>

A user can change the state of the addon in this file to 
enable/disable/unconfigure the addon. Next time when 
the server is restarted, the corresponding operation will actually become 
effective.

<p>
For ex. if one wants to unconfigure  <code>addon_name_configurator_01_01_00</code>, the value for configured will be set tofalse and when the server is restarted, the addon will be unconfigured for that domain. If the addon needs to be unconfigured across all domains which use this installation then move the <code>lib/addons/addon_name_configurator_01_01_00.jar</code> to <code>lib/addons/.deleted directory</code>.

<h3>Upgrade</h3>

To start with, the upgrade has been implemented for configurator and it can be implemented for installer based on the requirement. To detect upgrade for a configurator, a specific naming convention is used as given below.

<p>
<code>&lt;component_name&gt;_configurator_&lt;major&gt;_&lt;minor&gt;_&lt;patch level&gt;.jar</code>
<p>

for example:<br>
<code>am_components_configurator_01_01_00.jar</code>

<p>
The start-domain command causes the scanning of <code>lib/addons</code> directory and if a new version of the configurator is detected based on the above naming convention, then the upgrade method of the component's implementation will be invoked. The old configurator jar may then be removed or moved to <code>lib/addons/.deleted</code> directory.

<h2>Example Addon and Naming Convention</h2>

<pre>
addon_name_installer.jar
        |- META-INF/services/com.sun.appserv.addons.Installer
        |- InstallerImpl.class (implements Installer)
        |- InstallerUtil.class
        |- InstallerMore.class
        |- addon_name_01_01_00.jar
           |- META-INF/services/com.sun.appserv.addons.Configurator
           |- ConfiguratorImpl.class (implements Configurator)
           |- Another.class
           |- More.class
           |- Util.class 
</pre>
