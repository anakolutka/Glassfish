asadmin Utility Subcommands                delete-resource-ref(1)

NAME
     delete-resource-ref - removes a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     delete-resource-ref
     [--help]
      [ --target  target]
      reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-resource-ref command removes a reference  from  a
     cluster or an unclustered server instance to a resource (for
     example, a JDBC resource). This effectively results  in  the
     removal  of  the resource from the JNDI tree of the targeted
     instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they will no longer
     load the resource in the JNDI tree the next time they start.

     Removal of the reference does not result in removal  of  the
     resource  from  the  domain. The resource is removed only by
     the delete command for that resource (for  example,  delete-
     jdbc-resource).

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     reference_name              The name or  JNDI  name  of  the
                                 resource.
