NAME
     delete-jvm-options - removes options from  the  Java  confi-
     guration or profiler elements of the domain.xml file

SYNOPSIS
     delete-jvm-options
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target]
     [--profiler={true|false}] (jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_value])
     [:jvm_option_name[=jvm_option_name]]*

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jvm-options command removes command-line  options
     for the Java application launcher. These options are removed
     from the Java configuration element or profiler  element  of
     the domain.xml file.

     Note -

       In  the  syntax,  there  can  be  more  than  one  option,
       separated by a colon.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

     The  delete-jvm-options  command   deletes   the   following
     options:

         o    Java system properties. System properties  are  set
              through  the  -D  option  of  the  Java application
              launcher, for example:

             o    -Djava.security.manager

             o    -Denvironment=Production

         o    Startup parameters for the Virtual Machine for  the
              Java   platform   (Java   Virtual  Machine  or  JVM
              machine).

         The terms "Java Virtual Machine" and "JVM" mean  a  Vir-
         tual  Machine  for  the Java platform.Startup parameters
         are preceded by the dash character (-) , for example:

             o    --XX:PermSize=size

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

             o    -Xmx1024m

             o    -client

             o    -d64

     In the following situations, you must terminate the  command
     with a double-dash (--) before the options:

         o    You are specifying only one  system  property  with
              just   a   name   and   no   value,   for  example,
              -Djava.security.manager.

         o    You are specifying a startup parameter for the  JVM
              machine without a value, for example, -Xmx1024m

     The removal of some options requires a restart of the domain
     administration  server  (DAS)  to  become  effective.  Other
     options become immediately unavailable in the environment of
     the DAS and do not require a restart.

     Whether a restart is required depends on  the  type  of  the
     option.

         o    Restart is not required for Java system  properties
              whose  names  do not start with -Djava. or -Djavax.
              (including the trailing period). For example,  res-
              tart  is  not required for the Java system property
              -Denvironment=Production.

         o    Restart is required for the following options:

             o    System  properties  whose  names   start   with
                  -Djava.  or  -Djavax.  (including  the trailing
                  period), for example, -Djava.security.manager

             o    Startup parameters for  the  JVM  machine,  for
                  example, -Xmx1024m, -client or -d64

      To restart the DAS, use the restart-domain(1) command.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure
         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated  to  a  domain  by  using  the

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

         asadmin  login  command, you need not specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the JVM options are for the  profiler.
         The profiler must exist for this option to be true.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value
         the left side of the equal sign (=) is  the  JVM  option
         name.  The  right  side of the equal sign (=) is the JVM
         option value. A colon (:) is a  delimiter  for  multiple
         options.

         Note -

           If an option name or option value  contains  a  colon,
           the  backslash  (\fR) must be used to escape the colon
           in the name or  value.  Other  characters  might  also
           require  an  escape  character.  For  more information
           about escape characters in command  options,  see  the
           asadmin(1M) man page.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the delete-jvm-options command

     To remove more than one JVM  option,  use  a  colon  (:)  to
     separate  the  options.  If the JVM option itself contains a
     colon (:), use the backslash (\fR) to offset the  colon  (:)
     delimiter.
