<h1>
CallFlow Monitoring in GlassFish</h1>
<h2>
1.0 Introduction:</h2>
CallFlow framework (henceforth CallFlow) enables a application
developer/server administrator to monitor
the behaviour of applications deployed in the application server. A
developer can
use this feature at development time to see the application behaviour
An administrator can use this feature to see the behaviour
of deployed applications in the server.
<p>CallFlow collects runtime information about an application, like the
user principal, transaction id, application name, method name,
exceptions, time spent in various containers and time spent in
application code.
Call is monitored as it flows through various containers in the
application server and through the user application code.
For e.g: Consider a servlet that calls an ejb (method foo). In this
particular
scenario, CallFlow framework will monitor the request as it enters the
web container, servlet.service method,&nbsp; ejb container and finally
ejb method foo. The collected information is written to a persistent
store.
</p>
<p>Once information is collected, a user turns off CallFlow monitoring.
The user can look at the mined data about requests hitting the
application. A user can look at a particular request to drill down to
get
more information like the call stack and time spent in various
containers
as well as the application code.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>2.0 Setup</h2>
You application server must be running in order to utilize the callflow
monitoring feature in the appserver.&nbsp; To start the application
server,
use the CLI command.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % <i>cd
&lt;install-dir&gt;/bin</i>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % asadmin
start-domain
domain1</i>
<p>After the server has started up, you can access the Admin Console by
entering this URL :
<br>
<font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
http://localhost:4848</font>
</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</i> localhost is used if the both the
browser
and the Application Server are running on the same system. If the
Application
Server is running on another system, substitute the name of that system
in the URL.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 4848 is the Admin Console's default port
number.
If you are not sure about the port number, you can also refer to the
messages
given out by the asadmin start-domain command when starting up the
server.
</p>
<p>After you logged into the Admin Console, you can then configure the
server to enable call flow monitoring and/or look at the datas
collected.
</p>
<h2>3.0 Turning on CallFlow</h2>
<h3>
&nbsp;<a name="gui-configure-callflow"></a>3.1 Using Admin Console</h3>
Once you are logged into the Admin Console, follow these stesp to
configure
call flow monitoring.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In the tree component, select the Application Server
node.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click the Monitor tab.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click the Call Flow tab.&nbsp; The Call Flow
configuration
page displays.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Select Enabled to initiate call flow monitoring for
the server.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Specify the client host IP address and user ID for
which you want to enable monitoring.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can specify either the client host
IP address or the user's ID. Specify both IP address and user ID to
filter
for an exact match of user ID and IP address.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Click Save
</p>
<p><img src="imageD7K.JPG" height="784" width="857"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Note that you have to turn on call flow monitoring every time you
start
the server.&nbsp; This value does not persist upon server re-start.
<br>
To Turn off Call Flow Monitoring,&nbsp;&nbsp; Deselect the Enabled
check box.<br>
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2 Using Admin cli</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % <i>cd
&lt;install-dir&gt;/bin</i>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % asadmin
start-callflow-monitoring server</i>
<p></p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3 Using AMX Mbean</h3>
You can <span style="font-style: italic;">optionally</span> use the
application server AMX (<a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/amx/">Appserver
Management Extension</a>) API's to interact with the callflow
monitoring feature. CallFlow monitoring is exposed as an AMX MBean (<a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/nonav/javaee5/amx/javadoc/com/sun/appserv/management/monitor/CallFlowMonitor.html">javadoc</a>).
<br>
<br>
The CallFlowMonitor object is used to enable/disable callflow
monitoring
for application server instances and to obtain request/response
callflow
information. You can get the handle for CallFlowMonitor object using
the
following code sample.
<p>Connect to the JMX server in the application server instance using
your
Domain Application Server (DAS) username , password , jmx port number
(by
default it is 8686) and hostname
</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;TLSParams tlsParams=null;</i>
<br>
<i>AppserverConnectionSource conn = new AppserverConnectionSource(
AppserverConnectionSource.PROTOCOL_RMI, "localhost", 8686,
"admin_user",
"admin_password", tlsParams, null);</i>
<br>
<i>conn.getJMXConnector( true );</i>
<br>
<i>DomainRoot mDomainRoot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =
conn.getDomainRoot();</i>
</p>
<p>Now you have got the top level domain root handle , from which you
can
get the CallFlowMonitor object&nbsp; and set the callflow monitoring
enabled
flag to true.
</p>
<p><i>Map&lt;String,ServerRootMonitor&gt; serverRootMonitorMap =
mDomainRoot.getMonitoringRoot().getServerRootMonitorMap();</i>
<br>
<i>ServerRootMonitor serverRootMonitor =
serverRootMonitorMap.get("server");</i>
<br>
<i>serverRootMonitor.getCallFlowMonitor();</i>
<br>
<i>CallFlowMonitor cfm = getCallFlowMonitor();</i>
<br>
<i>cfm.setEnabled (true);</i>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>4.0 Excercising Application</h2>
We will be using stateless-simple.ear , a sample application that comes
with your server installation to demo the call flow monitoring
feature.&nbsp;
You can find it under
&lt;install-dir&gt;\samples\ejb\stateless\apps\simple\stateless-simple.ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it is not available, you can download <a
 href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/monitoring/callflow/stateless-simple.ear">stateless-simple.ear
from here</a>.
<br>
To experience how call flow monitoring works, and see the data
collected,&nbsp;
follow these steps:
<blockquote>
  <h4>4.1. Refer to <a href="#gui-configure-callflow">Section 3.1</a>
on how
to turn on call flow using Admin Console</h4>
  <h4>
4.2 Deploy the sample application</h4>
#&nbsp; In the left pane, click the Applications node to expand it.
  <br>

table,
listing the applications that has been successfully deployed.
  </p>
  <p><img src="imageVPC.JPG" height="489" width="987"><br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h4>4.3. Run the application</h4>
Now that the application has been deployed, we can run it by entering
the
following URL in another browser window.
  <br>
http://localhost:8080/helloworld
  <p><img src="imageGPC.JPG" height="259" width="782"></p>
  <p><img src="imageGDP.JPG" height="259" width="782"><br>
&nbsp;
  <br>
&nbsp;
  </p>
  <h4>4.4.&nbsp; Turn off CallFlow using Admin GUI<br>
  </h4>
After executing the application and the call flow data has been
collected,
you can turn off call flow monitoring by following these steps:
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In the tree component, select the Application Server
node.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click the Monitor tab.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click the Call Flow tab.&nbsp; The Call Flow
configuration
page displays.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. De-Select Enabled checkbox to turn off call flow
monitoring
for the server.
  <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click Save.
  <p><img src="imageIT8.JPG" height="674" width="856"></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5 Turn Off CallFlow using
admin cli</h4>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % <i>cd
&lt;install-dir&gt;/bin</i>
<br>
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % asadmin
stop-callflow-monitoring server</i><br>
&nbsp;
<h2>5.0 Viewing Results:</h2>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CallFlow Monitoring data is primarily to be
viewed via the admin gui. You can optionally use AMX api to get the
information programmatically. Call Flow monitoring data is available
regardless
of call flow monitoring is on or off.&nbsp; This data will be saved
until
user explicitly click the "Clear Data" button on the Call Flow monitor
page.
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.1 Accessing CallFlow Results via Admin GUI<br>
</h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admin Console shows the call flow monitoring data in
a tabular format, allowing you to only view the data thats of interest
to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; To view the data, go to the Call Flow Monitoring
page.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. In the tree component, select the Application Server
node.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click the Monitor tab.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click the Call Flow tab.
<br>
&nbsp; The Call Flow&nbsp; page displays.&nbsp; Scroll down to the
Call Flow Data section, and you will see the data being collected.
<br>
&nbsp;
<p><img src="imageCCH.JPG" height="842" width="871"></p>
<p>The table shows all the requests that have been sent to the server. <br>
</p>
<p>If you want to delete any particular request,&nbsp; select the check
box
of that row, and&nbsp; Click the Delete button.&nbsp; This will remove
the data permanently.
<br>
There is a drop down box that allows you to Filter the request.&nbsp;
By default, it will show you all the requests.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can pull
down the list, and see that you can filter the data based on
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Response:&nbsp;&nbsp; The final status of a particular
request : <tt>Success</tt> or <tt>Failure</tt></li>
  <li>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Start Container:&nbsp; The container that a particular
request entered in from. <tt>WEB, Web Services, EJB, Timer
EJB and Aysnchronous Message.</tt></li>
</ul>
Filtering will not remove the data, it will only affect the display of
the table.
<p>For detail information of each request,&nbsp; Click on the&nbsp; <tt>Time
Stamp&nbsp;</tt> column of that request,&nbsp; this will show you the
Call
Flow Detail page.
</p>
<p><img src="image6RV.JPG" height="962" width="872"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The table shows you the all the methods that has been called with
this
request, based on the calling sequence.
<br>
To see this in a hierarchical view.&nbsp; Click on the View Tree
button.
<br>
A window will pop up that shows each of the method&nbsp; in a
parent/child
hierarchy
</p>
<p><img src="image3DS.JPG" height="190" width="789"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Refe to <a href="#interpret">Section 6.0</a> for details on how to
interpret
the call flow monitoring data.
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.2 AMX MBean</h3>
To obtain the callflow monitoring data get the CallFlowMonitor object
as
mentioned in the section 3.2 and use the following code sample.
<br>
After you get the list of all requests through this method you can
iterate the list to obtain individual request info.
<p>List requeststack = cfm.queryRequestInformation ();
<br>
Iterator reqit = requeststack.iterator();
<br>
String request;
<br>
while(reqit.hasNext()){
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request=reqit.next().toString();
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System.out.println("Request
:&nbsp;
"+ request +"\n");
<br>
}
</p>
<p>The output of the above code will be something like this and it is
simply
the request received by the j2ee server instance.
</p>
<p>{MethodName=/callflowapp/standalonewebmod1_Servlet1:standalonewebmod1_Servlet1.service,
Exception=, TimeStampMillis=1138485885323,
RequestID=90b482e8-f44c-4572-bacd-235da6e4b171,
ClientHost=100.50.78.19, RequestType=REMOTE_WEB,
ApplicationName=URI:/callflowapp/standalonewebmod1_Servlet1,
User=anonymous, ResponseTime=39122000}
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To obtain the response stack for a request you need to use the
RequestID
field as obtained above to query the response stack. The following code
will illustrate this.
</p>
<p>String RequestID=90b482e8-f44c-4572-bacd-235da6e4b171;
</p>
<p>List&lt;Map&lt;String, String&gt;&gt; responsestack =
cfm.queryCallStackForRequest
(CallFlowUtil.getRequestID(RequestID));
<br>
if(responsestack != null){
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Iterator resit =&nbsp;
responsestack.iterator();
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while(resit.hasNext()){
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
System.out.println(resit.next().toString());
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<br>
}
</p>
<p>The above code will result in something like this
</p>
<p>{TimeStampMillis=1138485885323,
RequestID=90b482e8-f44c-4572-bacd-235da6e4b171,
RequestType=REMOTE_WEB, TimeStamp=164763933715400, CallStackRowType=<b>RequestStart</b>}
</p>
<p>{MethodName=/callflowapp/standalonewebmod1_Servlet1:standalonewebmod1_Servlet1.service,

<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2><a name="interpret"></a>6.0 Interpreting Results</h2>
<h3>&nbsp; 6.1 Main CallFlow View Page:</h3>
The main callflow page shows the list of all requests that have hit the
application server.<br>
<br>
<p><img src="imagePH8.JPG" height="278" width="927"><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp; The requests are in a chronological order and show the following
information:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>TimeStamp: the time stamp when a particular request made it into
the Application Server.</li>
  <li>User : the principal used to send the request. e.g: A call that
is made without any user principal shows up as "anonymous".</li>
  <li>Application: The application name that the request has been sent
to.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Start Container: The container that the request entered into the
application server from. There are 5 starting containers:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Web, EJB, Web Services, Timer EJB: e.g: a web request to the
application statless-simple started from the "WEB" container.</li>
    <li>Asynchronous Message: MDB and JMS requests entering the
Application Server are qualified as "Asynchronous Message" container.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Response Time in milli-seconds</li>
  <li>Response Status: Success or Failure.</li>
  <li>Client Host: The hostname of the client where the request came in
from.</li>
</ul>
To get detailed information of a particular request, you need to click
on the "Time Stamp" to go to the detailed view for that request.<br>
<h3>6.3 Detailed View Page:</h3>
The following image is for a request that was successfully serviced. <br>
<ul>
  <li>Request Information:</li>
  <li>Request Time Distribution: <br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>This table displays that the time taken by various containers
under each container that the call flowed through. We see that the "Web
Container" took about 3.882 ms, the "EJB Container" took about "14.149
ms" and the "ORB Container" took about 96.448 ms. The data tells us
that the major portion of the call servicing happened in the "Web
Application" code and to improve performance that is what we should
focus on. (Future version will actually tell us the time taken by each
individual method). A surprising result was the "ORB Container" code as
our application did not have remote method calls. We realized that
"Name Lookup" for ejbs do make it to the CosNaming Service and thus
exercise the ORB code.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Call Flow Steps: This lists the flow of the call.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The "Calling Sequence" lists the sequence of the call.</li>
    <li>The "Container" lists the containers that were exercised
directly by the application. We see that there were 2 containers
involved here "SERVLET" and the "STATELESS_SESSION_BEAN" container.
CallFlow does not lists containers that the user code has no influence
on. e.g: The "ORB CONTAINER". The rationale being the user can look at
the method and the module to improve upon his code but we do not want
to obscure the user with information that they cannot directly
influence.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Module: The module name that serviced the call.</li>
    <li>Component: the component name that serviced the call.</li>
    <li>Method : the method name that serviced the call.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
If you click the view tree, you see that the call originated in the
"SERVLET" container and was initially serviced by
"/helloworld/GreeterServlet:samples.ejb.stateless.simple.servlet.service"
method. This&nbsp; method then called the "The Greeter" ejb, this is a
"STATELESS_SESSION_BEAN" and the method called is "getGreeting" and it
is a remote method. This method returned successfully and then the
GreeterServlet called a jsp and the call was serviced by the
"JSPServlet"<br>
<br>
<p></p>
<p><img src="imageUFO.JPG" height="666" width="886"><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;The following shows the data for the same application wherein
there was an exception in the top servlet. The request has failed due
to a "java.lang.NullPointerException". In the "Call Flow Steps" table
we see that the call did not proceed beyond the
"standalonewebmod1_Servlet1", thus pointing to us that the call failed
in that particular service method.<br>
</p>
<p><img src="imageNMJ.JPG" height="485" width="923"><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h2>7.0 CallFlow vs Profiler</h2>
<ol>
Callflow monitoring operates non-intrusively; that is, the runtime
overhead is negligible. Whereas a profiler typically intrudes into and
changes the timing characteristics of application threads.
  <p>Callflow monitoring implementation has an intimate relationship
with
the container, and so it is able to collect information such as
application
name, module name, component name, component type, transaction id,
security
principal, et cetera. Such information is not readily available to a
profiler.
  </p>
  <p>Callflow monitoring implementation collects the call flow data and
stores
them in a database. In a future release, this raw data may be accessed
by third-party data mining tools, in order to slice and dice the data
in
infinite ways to project useful information in the form of graphs, pick
up trends, et cetera.
  </p>
  <p>Callflow monitoring provides the ability to monitor calls that
originate
specifically from a remote client and a user id. This allows selective
monitoring of requests, without unnecessarily intruding into other
parts
of the runtime system. This is very useful while running large scale
application
services such as internet sites that support thousands of concurrent
client.</p>
</ol>
<h2>
8.0 Conclusion</h2>
Use CallFlow monitoring during development time to understand the
behcviour
of your application. Determine the time spent by your application in
various
containers and the application code. Determine if the application
behaves
as expected as the call flows through various containers.
<p>Use CallFlow monitoring during production time to look at unexpected
behaviour and catch problematic applications. For e.g: say a request is
failing, you can drill down into the request and see the exception that
particular request fails with, identify the user making the request etc.<br>
</p>
<p>CallFlow framework is currently being used by the Application Server
Self Management code to receive events that trigger self-management
rules. It is also being used by the Application Verification Kit to
verify that applications conform to Java EE apis.<br>
<br>
CallFlow is a tool that can make your development and debugging easier.
