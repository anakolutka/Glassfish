<h1>Transfer Cluster Configurations Screen</h1>
<p>A Sun Java System Application Server 8.x Enterprise Edition (EE)
cluster configuration upgrade to Sun Java System Application Server 9.1
requires a valid <code>clinstance.conf</code> file.
The Upgrade Tool assumes that the <code>clinstance.conf</code> file is
an accurate reflection of the 8.x EE cluster. If, for some reason, this
file does not accurately represent the actual cluster configuration,
the cluster definition must be manually edited before the upgrade can
be performed.
</p>
<p>Use the Transfer Cluster Configurations screen to specify the
cluster configuration file(s) that need to be migrated to the new
installation.
</p>

  <li>Repeat this process until all the cluster configuration files
that must be migrated have been added.</li>
