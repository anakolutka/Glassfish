#
# CacheManagerImpl
#
EXC_MetaDataNotAvailable=Metadata for the owning Class is not available.
EXC_NonTransactional=Instance is not transactional.
EXC_ObjectExistsInCache=Object exists. Instance with the same primary key is already in the PersistenceManager cache.
EXC_NotOID=Given object is not a valid OID.
EXC_OIDNotCompatible=Given OID is not compatible with the given Class.
# NOI18N
EXC_ObjectIdExistsInCache=ObjectId {0} already exists in this PersistenceManager cache.
# NOI18N
EXC_ObjectIdNotExistsInCache=ObjectId {0} does not exist in this PersistenceManager cache.

#
# PersistenceManagerFactoryImpl
#
EXC_NotConfigurable=This instance of PersistenceManagerFactory is not configurable.
EXC_IntegerInInvalidFormat=Integer found in invalid format: should not happen!
EXC_IncompleteConfiguration=One of ConnectionURL, ConnectionFactory, or ConnectionFactoryName must be set before using this PersistenceManagerFactory.
EXC_WrongUsernamePassword=Cannot use multiple combinations of username/password in the same transaction.
# NOI18N
EXC_WrongJTATransaction=This instance of javax.transaction.Transaction is registered with another PersistenceManager.
EXC_PersistenceManagerFactoryClosed=This operation cannot be performed because this PersistenceManagerFactory is closed.
EXC_ActivePersistenceManager=This PersistenceManagerFactory cannot be closed while a PersistenceManager has an active transaction.
EXC_CannotAddShutdownHook=A SecurityException was thrown when trying \
to add a JVM shudown hook. In order to register a shutdown hook, \
you must grant java.lang.RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks") to the \
codeBases containing the JDO Reference Implementation (jdo-ri.jar).

#
# PersistenceManagerImpl
#
EXC_CannotGetRuntimeJavaModelFactory=A SecurityException was thrown when trying \
to get the singleton RuntimeJavaModelFactory instance. In order to get runtime \
metadata, you must grant com.sun.javax.jdo.spi.JDOPermission("getMetadata") to the \
codeBases containing the JDO Reference Implementation (jdo.jar and jdo-ri.jar).
EXC_ActiveTransaction=Cannot close PersistenceManager while transaction is still active.
EXC_WrongSCOType=Tracked SCO instances of type {0} are not supported.
EXC_CannotConstructSCO=Exception during construction of type {0}.
EXC_IllegalArguments=Wrong arguments for construction of type {0}.
EXC_PersistenceManagerClosed=PersistenceManager was closed.
EXC_TransactionNotActive=Transaction is not active.
EXC_NotPersistenceCapable=Class {0} not PersistenceCapable. The class of the instance does not implement PersistenceCapable. Check to see that the class has been enhanced and that the class path is correct (the unenhanced version of the class should not be in the class path).
EXC_CollectionType=Parameter is of a Collection type; use method {0}All(Collection).
EXC_ArrayType=Parameter is of an array type; use method {0}All(Object[]).
EXC_TransientInstance=Instance of class {0} is not persistent.
EXC_AnotherPersistenceManager=Object owned by another PersistenceManager.
EXC_ClassNotPersistenceCapable=Class given to getExtent, {0},  does not implement com.sun.javax.jdo.spi.PersistenceCapable
EXC_FailedToProcessAll=Failed to process all objects.
EXC_CannotFindSM=Could not find a StateManager for the given PersistenceCapable of class {0}.
# NOI18N
EXC_NotNullJTATransaction=Attempt to replace not null javax.transaction.Transaction.
EXC_UnsupportedQueryLanguage=Unsupported query language ''{0}''
EXC_CannotFindPCClassForObjectIdClass=Cannot find persistence-capable class for ObjectId class ''{0}''

#
# TransactionImpl
#
EXC_CannotChangeType=Cannot change transaction type during an active transaction.
EXC_CannotSetFlag=Cannot change flag value during commit or rollback processing.
EXC_CannotSetFlagIfActive=Cannot change flag value if transaction is active.
EXC_SynchronizationNotNull=A Synchronization object has already been set for this transaction.
EXC_ErrorBegin=Transaction has already begun.
EXC_TransactionRolledback=Transaction already rolled back or rollback in progress.
EXC_TransactionCommitting=Transaction has already started to commit.
EXC_MarkedRolledback=This transaction was marked rollback-only.
EXC_WrongStateCommit=Transaction in wrong state to commit.
EXC_WrongStateRollback=Transaction in wrong state to rollback.

EXC_WrongMgdOperation=Operation {0} is not allowed in managed environment.
EXC_WrongNonMgdOperation=Operation {0} is not allowed in non-managed environment.
EXC_NontransactionalRead=This operation requires that a transaction be active or the NontransactionalRead flag be true.
EXC_AfterCompletion=Problems during afterCompletion call to Synchronization object.
# NOI18N
EXC_ErrorRegister=Cannot register this instance with JTA Synchronization.
