<A NAME="ablud"></A><h2>Thread Pools</h2>
<p>This section describes thread pools and how they work in the Application Server.</p>
<p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can support many threads of execution
at once. To help performance, the Application Server maintains one or more thread
pools. It is possible to assign specific thread pools to connector modules
and to the ORB.</p>
<p>One thread pool can serve multiple connector modules and enterprise
beans. Request threads handle user requests for application components. When
the server receives a request, it assigns the request to a free thread from
the thread pool. The thread executes the client's requests and returns results.
For example, if the request needs to use a system resource that is currently
busy, the thread waits until that resource is free before allowing the request
to use that resource.</p>
<p>Specify the minimum and maximum number of threads that are reserved
for requests from applications. The thread pool is dynamically adjusted between
these two values. The minimum thread pool size that is specified signals the
server to allocate at least that many threads in reserve for application requests.
That number is increased up to the maximum thread pool size that is specified.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of threads available to a process allows the process
to respond to more application requests simultaneously.</p>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-200"></A>Avoid thread starvation, where one resource adapter or application
occupies all threads in the Application Server, by dividing the Application Server threads
into different thread-pools.</p>
