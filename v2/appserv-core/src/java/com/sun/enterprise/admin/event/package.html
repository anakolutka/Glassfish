  <H4>Notifications in iAS 7.0 SE.</H4>

  <P>Several notifications are sent from admin server instance to administered
  server instance(s). The notification is in the form of a event. There are four
  categories of events - Deployment, Monitoring, ConfigurationChange and
  Shutdown.</P>

  <P>Deployment events are for applications, stand alone modules and resources
  and are raised whenever something is undeployed, redeployed, deployed, enabled
  or disabled. Monitoring Events are used to start and stop monitoring, to get
  monitoring data and to list monitorable components. ConfigurationChange events
  are raised whenever there is an apply action on UI for all changes that can
  not be categorized as Deployment or Monitoring event. ShutdownEvent is there
  because it was in functional specification, but it is unlikely to be used.</P>

  <P>The method multicastEvent() in the class AdminEventMulticaster can be used
  to multicast events (to all listeners in appropriate administered server
  instance).</P>

  <P>The various register methods in the class AdminEventListenerRegistry can
  be used to register listeners for a event.</P>
