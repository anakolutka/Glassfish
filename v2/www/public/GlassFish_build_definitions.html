<h3>GlassFish build definitions</h3>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">nightly builds</span>:&nbsp; These
builds are produced each night from all changes commited during the day
to the main branch of the workspace.&nbsp; Quicklook tests are run but
are not required to pass to publish the builds.&nbsp; There a decent
chance that major features may not be working.&nbsp; These builds are
most useful for developers of GlassFish or developers of related
technologies who are looking for bug fixes between promoted
builds.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">promoted builds</span>:&nbsp; Builds
are promoted weekly and only promoted if they pass all quicklook tests,
a subset of the CTS tests (representative collection of 263 J2EE 1.4
tests) as well as a subset (22 in number) of the software quality
engineering tests.&nbsp; The tests run are board in nature trying to
find regressions in the code.&nbsp; Applications can be deployed and
run on these builds though there may be some areas that are not working
well.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">milestone builds</span>:&nbsp; These
builds are promoted builds which have a targeted set of features.&nbsp;
They do go through additional testing after the builds are
promoted.&nbsp; These builds are useful to users who are interested in
the latest features of the product.&nbsp; <br>
