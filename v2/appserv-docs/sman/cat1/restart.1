NAME
     hadbm-restart, restart - restarts the database

SYNOPSIS
     restart [--no-rolling] [database_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the restart command to restart the  database.  Once  the

     In interactive mode, the restart command prompts for a  con-
     firmation before restarting the database.
