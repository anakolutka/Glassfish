/**
 *Represents dynamic content in template form.
 *<p>
 *This class also keeps track of the most recent times the object's template
 *was used to generate content that was different from the result of the
 *previous generation using this template.  This
 *information is used in responding to HTTP HEAD requests.  Java Web Start uses
 *HEAD requests to find out if a document on the server is more recent than
 *the locally cached copy on the client.  If so, then Java Web Start will 
 *request the updated version with a routine GET request. 
 *<p>
 *To avoid incorrectly reporting obsolete cached documents as current, this
 *class keeps track of when the content generated by the template is different
 *from the previous generation.  
 *<p>
 *The generated content can depend on request-time information
 *(such as command line arguments passed in the query string of the HTTP request).
 *We save and track only a few individual response instances, because the assumption
 *is that requests that carry query strings (which are converted into command line
 *arguments passed to ACC and on through to the app client) are likely to change
 *frequently and not necessarily be reused often.  Keeping a few allows caching
 *the different content resulting from a small number of different argument
 *value settings, but avoids the problems of caching every single response
 *which could become a large memory drain if each request specified a 
 *different set of arguments (for instance, one of the arguments could be a
 *timestamp that would change every time).
