NAME
     generate-jvm-report - shows the threads, classes and  memory
     for a given target instance.

SYNOPSIS
     generate-jvm-report   [--terse=false]   [--echo=false]   [--
     interactive=true]   [--host  localhost]  [--port  4848]  [--
     secure|-s] [--user admin_user] [--passwordfile filename]  [-
     -help] [target] [--type=summary|memory|class|thread]

DESCRIPTION
     This command  shows  the  threads  (dump  of  stack  trace),
     classes  and  memory  for a given target instance, including
     the Domain Administration Service.  This command works  only
     with the application server instance processes. This command
     replaces the traditional techniques like sending  ctrl+break
     or kill -3 signals to application server processes. The com-
     mand will not work if the target server instance is not run-
     ning.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --type                  The type of  report  user  wants  to
                             see.

                               o  summary, which displays summary
                                  information      about      the
                                  threads/classes and memory.

                               o  memory, which provides informa-
                                  tion  about  heap  and non-heap
                                  memory   consumption,    memory
                                  pools,  and  garbage collection
                                  statistics for a  given  target
                                  instance

                               o  classes, which  gives  informa-
                                  tion about the class loader for
                                  a given target instance

                               o  threads, which provides  infor-
                                  mation  about  threads  running
                                  and  the  thread  dump   (stack
                                  trace)   for   a  given  target
                                  instance.

OPERANDS
