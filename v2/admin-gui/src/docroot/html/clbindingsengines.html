<a name="clbindingsengines"></a><h3>JBI Components</h3>
<a name="indexterm-110"></a><a name="indexterm-111"></a><p>A JBI component is either a Service Engine or a Binding Component. Service
Engines are components that provide local services (that is, services within the JBI
environment) and consume local or remote services. Binding Components are proxies for consumers
or providers that are outside the JBI environment. Binding components typically are based on
a standard communications protocol, such as FTP, JMS, or SMTP, or a call
to an external service, such as SAP or WebSphere MQ.</p><p>From the Admin Console, you can do the following operations on JBI components:</p>
<ul><li><p>View JBI components by their specific lifecycle states and component type. To view the components by their lifecycle state, use the State drop-down list. To view the components by their type, use the Type drop-down list.</p></li>
<li><p>Install JBI components. For steps to install JBI components, see <a href="clnewbindingorengine1.html">To Install a JBI Component</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Delete JBI components. This removes JBI components from all the targets and deletes them from the JBI repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable or disable JBI components. Enabling or disabling JBI components applies to all targets to which the components are installed. </p></li></ul>
