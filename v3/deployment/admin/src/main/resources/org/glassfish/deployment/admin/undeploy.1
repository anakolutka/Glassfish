NAME
     undeploy - removes a deployed component

SYNOPSIS
     undeploy
     [--help]
     [ --droptables =true|false]
     [--cascade=false] [ --target  target]
     component_name

DESCRIPTION
     The undeploy command removes  the  specified  deployed  com-
     ponent.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --droptables
         If set to true, tables that the application  created  by
         using  CMP  beans  during  deployment  are  dropped. The
         default is the corresponding entry in  the  cmp-resource
         element  of  the sun-ejb-jar.xml file. If not specified,
         it defaults to the entries specified in  the  deployment
         descriptors.

     --cascade

         If set to true, it deletes all the connection pools  and
         connector resources associated with the resource adapter
         being undeployed. If set to false, the undeploy fails if
         any  pools  and  resources are still associated with the
         resource adapter. Then, either those pools and resources
         have  to  be deleted explicitly, or the option has to be
         set to true. If the option is set to false, and if there
         are  no  pools  and  resources still associated with the
         resource adapter, the resource  adapter  is  undeployed.
         This   option  is  applicable  to  connectors  (resource
         adapters) and applications.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error  does  not  occur.  Instead,  the

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Simple undeployment

     Undeploy (uninstall) an enterprise application Cart.ear.

       asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt Cart
       Command undeploy executed successfully.

     Example 2 Undeploying an  enterprise  bean  with  container-
     managed persistence (CMP)

     Undeploy a CMP bean named myejb and drop  the  corresponding
     database  tables.  In  a  production  environment,  database
     tables contain valuable information, so use the --droptables
     option with care.

       asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt --droptables=true myejb
       Command undeploy executed successfully.

     Example 3 Undeploy a connector (resource adapter)

     Undeploy the connector module named  jdbcra  and  perform  a
     cascading delete to remove the associated resources and con-
     nection pools.

       asadmin> undeploy --user admin --passwordfile password.txt --cascade=true jdbcra
       Command undeploy executed successfully.
