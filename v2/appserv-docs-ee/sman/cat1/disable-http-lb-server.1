NAME
     disable-http-lb-server - disables a sever or cluster managed
     by a load balancer

SYNOPSIS
     disable-http-lb-server  --user  admin_user   [--passwordfile
     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]
     [--timeout 30] target

DESCRIPTION
     This command disables a stand-alone  server  or  cluster  of
     servers  for load balancing. The disabled server instance or
     cluster goes offline  for  load  balancing  with  a  minimum
     impact to users.

     Once the target has been disabled and the changes have  been
     applied  to  the  load  balancer,  the  load  balancer stops
     assigning new requests to the target. Session requests  with
     sessions  created before disabling the target continue to be
     assigned to that target until the timeout is  reached.  This
     process is known as quiescing.

     Apply changes to the load balancer either automatically,  or
     using  the command apply-http-lb-changes. You can also manu-
     ally export the  configuration  using  export-http-lb-config
     and copy it to the load balancer.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the

                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --timeout               The timeout  (in  minutes)  to  wait
                             before  disabling the specified tar-
                             get. This time allows for the grace-
                             ful   shutdown  (quiescing)  of  the
                             specified target. The default  value
                             is  30 minutes. The minimum value is
                             1 minute.

OPERANDS
