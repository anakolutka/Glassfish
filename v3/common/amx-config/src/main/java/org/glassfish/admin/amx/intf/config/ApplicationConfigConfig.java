/**
Abstract base interface for an element which extends the @Configured type 'ApplicationConfig'.
<p>
This base interface should be extended by sub-interfaces representing configuration, eg
WebAppConfigConfig; there can be new such sub-interfaces defined by modules not yet written.
<p>
The actual type  is defined by the interface and these are {@link Singleton} because
the type alone makes the item unique within its scope (there can be only one such element
of any given type).
