NAME
     start-node-agent - starts a node agent

SYNOPSIS
     start-node-agent --user user  [--passwordfile  passwordfile]
     [--secure=true]     [--terse=false]    [--echo=false]    [--
     interactive=true]       [--verbose=false]        [--agentdir
     nodeagent_path] [--startinstances=true] [nodeagent_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the start-node-agent command start a  node  agent.   The
     command will return control to the user before instances are
     actually started. The list-instances command can be executed
     to  see if they have actually started. This command may take
     a while to execute since the node agent may need  to  create
     and start a number of server instances.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the -- password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name  of a file containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The entry for the password must have
                             the AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the
                             password  name  in  capital letters.
                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_SAVEDMASTERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD, and so on.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --verbose               By  default  this  flag  is  set  to
                             false.  If  set  to  true, a console
                             window is opened for the node  agent
                             and for every server instance a node
                             agent  manages.  On  Windows,  press
                             Ctrl-Break in the console to print a
                             thread dump.  On UNIX,  press  CTRL-
                             Backslash  in the console to print a
                             thread dump. The node  agent  thread
                             dump goes to its console. The server
                             instance thread  dump  goes  to  the
                             instance log file.

      --agentdir             Like a Domain Administration  Server
                             (DAS),  each node agent resides in a
                             top    level     directory     named
                             agentdir/nodeagent_name.  If  speci-
                             fied, the path must be accessible in
                             the  filesystem.  If  not specified,

                             defaults           to            the
                             install_dir/nodeagents directory.

      --startinstances       If set to true, all server instances
                             that  are  not currently running are
                             started. If set to false,  instances
                             are  not  started.  If the option is
                             omitted, it defaults to the value of
                             the  node  agent's start-servers-in-
                             startup attribute,  located  in  the
                             domain.xml file.

OPERANDS
     nodeagent_name          The name of the  node  agent  to  be
                             started.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the start-node-agent command

     asadmin> start-node-agent --user admin --passwordfile passwordfile nodeagent1
     Nodeagent1 started.

     The  node  agent  nodeagent1  is  started  in  the   default
     install_dir/nodeagents directory.

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
