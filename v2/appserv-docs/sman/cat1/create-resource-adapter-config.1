NAME
     create-resource-adapter-config - creates  the  configuration
     information in domain.xml for the connector module

     echo=false]  [--interactive=true] [--host localhost] [--port
     4848]  [--secure|-s]  [--user  admin_user]   [--passwordfile

     (property name=value)[:name=value]*] raname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-adapter-config  command  creates  confi-
     guration  information for the connector module. This command
     can be executed prior to deploying a  resource  adapter,  so
     that  the configuration information is available at the time
     of deployment. The  resource  adapter  config  can  also  be
     created  after  the  resource  adapter  is deployed. In this
     case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new  confi-
     guration.  You  must  first  create  a threadpool, using the
     create-threadpool command, and then identify that threadpool
     value as the ID in the --threadpoolid option.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should

                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,
                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For

                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the
                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --target                This option has been deprecated.

     --threadpoolid          The threadpool  ID  from  which  the
                             work  manager gets the thread.  This
                             option takes only one threadpool ID.

     --property              This option specifies the configura-
                             tion   properties  of  the  resource
                             adapter java  bean.  The  properties
                             can be specified as name value pairs
                             separated by a colon (:).

OPERANDS
     raname                  This operand indicates the connector
                             module  name. It is the value of the
                             resource-adapter-name     in     the
                             domain.xml file.
