NAME
     list-connector-security-maps  -  lists  the  security   maps
     belonging to the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     list-connector-security-maps
     [--help]
      [  --securitymap  security_map_name ]
      [--verbose={false|true}] connector_connection_pool_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to list the security maps belonging to  the
     specified connector connection pool.

     For this command to succeed, you must have first  created  a
     connector   connection   pool  using  the  create-connector-
     connection-pool command.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --verbose
         If set to true, returns a list including  the  identity,
         principals, and security name. The default is false.

     --securitymap

         Specifies the name of the security map contained  within
         the  connector  connection  pool from which the identity
         and principals should be listed. With  this  option,  --
         verbose is redundant.

OPERANDS
     connector_connection_pool_name
         Name of the connector connection pool for which you want
         to list security maps.
