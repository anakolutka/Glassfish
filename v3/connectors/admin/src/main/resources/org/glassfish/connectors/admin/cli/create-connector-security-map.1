NAME
     create-connector-security-map - creates a security  map  for
     the specified connector connection pool

SYNOPSIS
     create-connector-security-map
     [--help]
       --poolname  connector_connection_pool_name
     [--principals principal_name1[, principal_name2]* |
     --usergroups user_group1[, user_group2*]
      --mappedusername  username  {security_map_name}

DESCRIPTION
     Use this command to create a security map for the  specified
     connector  connection  pool.  If  the  security  map  is not
     present, a new one is created. Also, use this command to map
     the  caller  identity  of the application (principal or user
     group) to a  suitable  EIS  principal  in  container-managed
     transaction-based scenarios. One or more named security maps
     may be associated with a connector connection pool. The con-
     nector  security  map  configuration supports the use of the
     wild card asterisk (*) to indicate all  users  or  all  user
     groups.

     For this command to succeed, you must have first  created  a
     connector   connection   pool  using  the  create-connector-
     connection-pool command.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

          This property specifies the EIS username.

OPERANDS
     security_map_name
         The name of the security map to be created or updated.

     created using the create-connector-pool command.

       asadmin> create-connector-security-map --user admin
       --passwordfile pwd_file.txt --poolname connector-pool1
        --principals principal1, principal2
       --mappedusername backend-username securityMap1
