Below are a list of valid options.
To use the longname, prepend it with '--'.  
To use a short name prepend it with '-'.  
The webapp war file names should be supplied after all the options.
You can enter as many web apps as you like.

To start an embedded GlassFish server with a web application packaged in a WAR on port 8080:

    java -jar glassfish-embedded-all-3.0-Prelude-SNAPSHOT.jar -p 8080 myapp.war

Files that the embedded GlassFish server uses are located in its installation and
instance directories. If the installation or instance directories to be used are not specified,
they will be created in the directory where you start embedded GlassFish server.
    * default installation directory - embedded_####_glassfish
    * default instance directory - embedded_####_glassfish\domains\domain1

The docroot is located under the instance directory: 
    <instance directory>\docroot

To use as a lightweight web server, copy HTML pages to the docroot and start the server:

    java -jar glassfish-embedded-all-3.0-Prelude-SNAPSHOT.jar -p 8080

    http://localhost:8080/MyWebPage.html

The autodelete option specifies whether files that the embedded GlassFish
server uses are deleted when the embedded GlassFish server is stopped.
If this option is true, the files are deleted.
If this option is false, the files are not deleted.

The default behavior depends on whether the --installdir option or --instancedir option is set:

    * If the --installdir option or --instancedir option is set, the default is false.
    * If the --installdir option or --instancedir option is not set, the default is true.
