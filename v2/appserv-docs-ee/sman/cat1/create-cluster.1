DESCRIPTION
     The create-cluster command  creates  a  new  cluster.   When
     created,  a  cluster  must reference a configuration (or, as
     with an unclustered server instance, a configuration can  be
     implicitly  created).  Initially  the  cluster has no server
     instances, applications, or resources.

     If you do not use the --config option, the command creates a
     standalone  cluster with a configuration named cluster_name-
     config.

     In Sun Java System  Application  Server  Enterprise  Edition
     only,  you  can create the HADB database associated with the
     cluster. To create it, specify the  HADB  hosts  option.  In
     addition,  optionally specify any other HADB options such as
     haagentport and devicesize.  The created  database  has  the
     same  name  as  the  cluster,  and  includes all the correct
     tables. The cluster must be a standalone cluster in order to
     successfully  associate  an  HADB  database  with it. If you
     prefer to associate the HADB database to the cluster  later,
     use configure-ha-cluster.

     To add new instances to the cluster, use the create-instance
     command with the --cluster option. Use the stop-instance and
     delete-instance commands to delete server instances from the
     cluster at any time.

     To associate new applications and resources with the cluster
     regardless  of  the number of instances in the cluster, per-
     form any of the following operations:

       o  Use  the  deploy  command  with  the  option   --target
          cluster_name.

       o  Use resource-creation commands  (for  example,  create-
          jdbc-resource) with the option --target cluster_name.

       o  Use  reference  management   commands   (for   example,
          create-application-ref  or  create-resource-ref) if the
          application is already  deployed  or  the  resource  is
          already created.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default

                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --config                Creates a shared cluster. The speci-
                             fied  configuration  name must exist
                             and must not be default-config  (the
                             standalone   cluster   configuration
                             template) or a standalone configura-
                             tion  (including server-config).  If
                             this option is omitted, a standalone
                             cluster is created.

     --systemproperties      Defines system  properties  for  the
                             configuration  created  for  by  the
                             cluster. These  properties  override
                             the  property values in the default-
                             config configuration. The  following

                             start, stop, or delete the  cluster.
                             The  default  is  false. To override
                             this setting, use  the  hadboverride
                             option   in   start-cluster,   stop-
                             cluster, or delete-cluster.

     --portbase              This option is available only in the

                             Default is 15200. Valid  values  are
                             between 10000 and 63000.

OPERANDS
     cluster_name            A unique identifier for the  cluster
                             to be created.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the create-cluster command

     The following command creates  a  cluster  named  MyCluster,
     overriding  the  default  configuration's  SSL  port  value.
     Because the --config option is not  specified,  the  command
     makes  a  copy of the default-config and names it MyCluster-
     config.

     asadmin> create-cluster --user admin1
     --passwordfile passwords.txt --systemproperties
     IIOP_SSL_LISTENER_PORT=1169 MyCluster
     Command create-cluster executed successfully.

     Example 2: Creating HADB when creating cluster

     In Sun Java System  Application  Server  Enterprise  Edition
     only,  the  following  command  creates  an HADB database on
     hosts host1 and host2 while creating the cluster cluster1:

     asadmin> create-cluster --user admin1
     --passwordfile passwords.txt --hosts hos1,host2 cluster1
     Command create-cluster executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully
