<a name="upgradeprofile"></a><h4>To Add Cluster Support to a Domain</h4><p>If your domain is not configured to support clustering, and you require to
use clustering features of Application Server, add cluster support to the domain. For
example, a domain that is running a developer profile is not configured to
support clustering. Use the Admin Console Application Server node General tab to upgrade
the domain to support clustering.</p><p>The implications of adding cluster support to a domain are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><p>The <tt>domain.xml</tt> file of the domain is modified to support clustering. The modifications include, for example, the addition of system properties and changes to the template configuration. Only the <tt>domain.xml</tt> file is modified. All other files in the domain's directory are left unchanged.</p></li>
<li><p>The server will support both clusters and standalone server instances. </p></li>
<li><p>By default, in-memory replication will be used for applications that are required to be highly available.</p></li>
<li><p>All the applications that are currently deployed on the server will continue to work.</p></li>
<li><p>This change will take effect after the server is restarted and, if CLI multimode is running, after the <tt>asadmin</tt> CLI is restarted.</p></li></ul>
<h6>Before You Begin</h6><p>To enable you to revert the domain to its original configuration if necessary,
back up the <tt>domain.xml</tt> file of the domain.</p><p>Because the administration server will support clusters after the upgrade, consider enhancing JVM
settings such as <tt>heap-size</tt>.</p><ol>
<li><b>Select the Application Server node.</b></li>
<li><b>In the General Information page, click Add Cluster Support.</b></li>
<li><b>Review the implications of this procedure.</b></li>
<li><b>Click OK.</b><p>The Admin Console displays a message that indicates that a restart is required.</p></li>
<li><b>Click Stop Instance.</b><p>The Admin Console displays that the application domain has been shutdown.</p></li>
<li><b>If the CLI multimode is running (which means that you are running commands
from the asadmin prompt), exit asadmin and restart.</b></li>
<li><b>Verify that the domain is stopped by using the <tt>asadmin list-domains</tt> command.</b></li>
<li><b>Start the newly upgraded cluster domain by using the <tt>asadmin start-domain</tt> command.</b></li>
<li><b>Launch the Admin Console.</b><p>The common tasks page now includes cluster-related tasks, indicating that the domain now
supports clustering features.</p></li></ol>
