<h3><a name="GlassFish_Project_Information"></a>GlassFish Project
Information</h3>
This project provides a structured process for developing a better
quality application server platform that makes the new features of Java
EE&nbsp;
5 available faster than ever before while maintaining the most
important feature of Java EE - compatibility. It is the response to
Java
developers who want access to the source code and want to contribute to
the development of Sun's next generation application server. This
project is designed to encourage communication between Sun engineers
and the community and will enable all developers to participate in
Sun's application server development process.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why become part of the GlassFish
project?</span><br>
<br>
You'll get the chance to contribute to the development of a world class
application server on which many of the top companies in the world are
running their businesses. Project members have complete access to all
of the code and documentation for Sun Java System Application Server PE
9 and Java EE 5 as well as tests and build information. Download
nightly
builds of AS PE 9 and Java EE 5 and watch as the platform evolves in
real-time. Sometimes it won't be pretty, but it'll always be
interesting.<br>
<br>
You'll have the opportunity to be involved in the implementation of
cutting edge Enterprise Java, Web Services and SOA standards. What
better place to learn about the latest Enterprise Java technologies and
improve your skills (or show off the skills you already have) than as
part of the GlassFish project?<br>
<br>
If you're deploying on Sun Java System Application Server PE 9.0 and
you
run into a bug that's critical to fix, you won't have to wait for the
next release or make your way through a formal support channels. You
can have the power to go in and fix the bug yourself and get on with
your work. We know that the quality of any piece of software gains from
having more people review the code. You'll have the knowledge that your
fix benefits not only you but everyone in the community.<br>
<br>
You'll get to interact with a great group of people inside and outside
of Sun. Sun employs some of the most talented Enterprise Java
programmers on the planet but we know many more exist outside of
Sun.&nbsp; You'll have the chance to participate in discussions with
some of the leading names in the Java community - folks who invented
Enterprise Java and made it what it is today. We know we'll learn a lot
from you and we think you'll learn a thing or two from us as well.<br>

<h3><a name="Request_a_Feature"></a>Request a Feature</h3>
<p>GlassFish uses an Issue Tracker to track features along with bugs
and
patches. First conduct a query of the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">GlassFish
issue database</a> to determine whether the feature has been already
requested by others to avoid
duplicated requests. If an issue <em>does not exist</em>, submit
your feature as a new issue (see s<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/public/NewtoGlassFish.html#Submit_a_Bug">ubmit a bug</a>), using the <code>Feature</code> link in
the <code>Enter An Issue</code> section of the <code>Issue Tracking</code>
page. Any
background on the feature requested along with possible patches that
will support developing the feature will help get the requested
features
added to the project.</p>
