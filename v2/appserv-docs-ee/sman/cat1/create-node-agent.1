DESCRIPTION
     The node agent facilitates remote  server  instance  manage-
     ment.  It is the responsibility of the node agent to create,
     start, stop, and delete a server instance. Every node  agent
     must  have  a unique name and every new server instance must
     be created with a reference to a node  agent  name  defining
     the  machine on which the instance will reside. A node agent
     must  be  present  on  every  machine  that   hosts   server
     instances, including the machine hosting the Domain Adminis-
     tration Server (DAS).

     The DAS connection options (host, port, user)  identify  the
     agent's  initial  target domain. The DAS does not need to be
     running when the node agent is being created. When the  node
     agent  is  started, the agent attempts to contact the DAS to
     join the domain.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the

                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

      --agentdir             Like a Domain Administration  Server
                             (DAS),  each node agent resides in a
                             top    level     directory     named
                             agentdir/nodeagent_name.  If  speci-
                             fied, the path must be accessible in
                             the  filesystem.  If  not specified,
                             the node agent  is  created  in  the
                             default       install_dir/nodeagents
                             directory.

      --agentport            The port on which the  node  agent's
                             JMX  connector  listens  and accepts
                             requests. If not specified,  then  a
                             random unused port is chosen.

      --agentproperties      The  following  agentproperties  are
                             available:

                             ________________________________________________________________
                            |      Property                        Definition               |
                            | listenaddress         The address used by the JMX connector to|
                            |                       listen  for  requests  or notifications.|
                            |                       The default is 0.0.0.0.                 |
                            | remoteclientaddress   The address  used by DAS to  connect  to|
                            |                       the  Node  Agent.   The  default  is the|
                            |                       hostname of the server.                 |
                            | loglevel              The initial log level at which  messages|
                            |                       are logged. The default is INFO.        |
                            |_______________________________________________________________|

     --savemasterpassword    Setting this option to  true  allows
                             the  masterpassword to be written to
                             the file system. This  is  necessary
                             so that the start-domain command can
                             start the server without  having  to
                             prompt  the user. However, for secu-
                             rity purposes, the  default  setting
                             is  false  because saving the master
                             password on the disk is an  insecure
                             practice.

OPERANDS
     nodeagent_name          The name of the node agent  must  be
                             unique  in the domain. If not speci-
                             fied, the nodeagent_name defaults to
                             the machine's host name.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using create-node-agent

     asadmin>create-node-agent --host host1 --port 4849 --user admin1
     --passwordfile password.txt nodeagent1
     Node Agent nodeagent1 created.

     The  node  agent  nodeagent1  was  created  in  the  default
     install_dir/nodeagents directory.

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
