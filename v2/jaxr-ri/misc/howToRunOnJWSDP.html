<h4 align="left"><a name="Getting the tests">How do I get the tests:</a></h4>
<p align="left">The JAXR workspace is available on the jeeves.sfbay server. You need to
check out the jaxr-test module to get the test workspace<sup><a href="#Note 1">1</a></sup>.
Alternately, you could get a tar-ball from <a href="http://j2ee.east.sun.com/sqe/wspack/jaxr/iPlanet/iPlanetDrop.tar">here</a>.<sup><a href="#Note 2">2</a></sup><br>
</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Running the tests">How do I run the tests:</a></h4>
<p align="left"><i><b>Note:</b> In the following discussion, ${jaxr.test.home}
denotes the directory where you installed the JAXR Test Workspace and
${j2ee.home} is your J2EE installation root.</i></p>
<p align="left">The workspace uses ant to run the tests. You have the
flexibility to run all the tests in the workspace or a subset. The tests are
organized in a tree structure, and running ant at any node in the tree will run
all the tests from that node down.</p>
<p align="left">To run all the tests in the workspace go to the ${jaxr.test.home}/test/jaxr
directory and type <i>ant</i> at the prompt [As mentioned in the following
paragraph, you can also set command line properties here to over-ride the
default settings.]</p>
<p align="left">At the end of a test-run, the logs are generated in a
time-stamped directory under ${jaxr.test.home}/logs. The directory structure for
the generated logs directory looks similar to the one shown below:</p>
<p align="left">${jaxr.test.home}/logs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |___20030520<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|_____jwsdp-ms-SunOS-5.9-jdk1.4<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
|_____&lt;log files&gt;</p>
<p align="left">The tests use Reporter to produce XML result files. To generate
HTML reports from these, type <i>ant generateHTMLReport</i> at the prompt. This
will produce an html report (result.html) in the same directory as the log
files. [Note: If&nbsp; you override either <i>test.env</i> or <i>test.env.registry
</i>on the command line, when you run the tests, you need to make sure you do
the same when generating the HTML report. This is because these values are used
in computing the log directory and ant would not remember the settings from one
run to the other]</p>
<p align="left">As a general rule, all user-modifications for running the JAXR tests should be done only in ${jaxr.test.home}/config/jaxr-commons.xml (It has a section at the top which indicates the modifiable properties) All these properties have default values in the files. To override these, the recommended way is to specify the appropriate values on the command line when invoking ant (E.g. ant -Dtest.env.registry=private to run the tests against the UDDI registry-server) [ Note: Unless, of course, you want to change the default itself, in which case you should modify these properties in the jaxr-commons.xml  file and these would become your default settings ]<br>
<br>
Here are some important properties and their default settings (For detailed documentation, please
browse the jaxr-commons.xml file )<br>
1.)  test.env.registry : private (for running against the
UDDI registry-server. Setting up the registry-server is not done by the scripts.
This needs to be done separately)<br>
[<i>Note:</i> Running the private registry on SunOne is not supported due to a
known issue. If you wish to test the jaxr tests in a SunOne environment against
the private registry, please start the private registry bundled with JWSDP, and
point to it in the registry properties file]&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.)  test.env : Default - jwsdp. Acceptable values:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><i>jwsdp </i>: For running the tests on the Java Web
    Services Developer Pack</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><i>jaxpack</i> : For running the tests on the Java and XML
    Pack&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><i>s1as</i>: For running the tests on the SunOne App Server
    7.0 Personal Edition (Evaluation copy). Before running the tests, the JWSDP
    libraries must be integrated with SunOne by running the jwsdponsunone
    scripts bundled with the JWSDP.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><i>s1as8</i>: For running the tests on the SunOne App Server
    8.0 Technology Preview edition (The JWSDP libraries are already bundled with
    S1AS 8.0, so you do <i>not</i> need to run the integration scripts.)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
3.) test.env.vmargs : Default - &quot;&quot; (empty string) Acceptable values:
anything that you would like to pass to the JVM running the test.<br>
<br>
In addition to the above, there is a one-time configuration that you need to do in the jaxr-commons.xml file. In the top portion of the file, there are pointers to your jwsdp, j2ee,
s1as (for S1AS 7.0) ,s1as8 (for S1AS 8.0)&nbsp; and jaxpack installations. You need to make sure these are pointed to the correct locations.
(You need to set the pointers only for the environments you would be using. The
rest would be ignored. E.g, if you are running the tests on s1as8, you do not
need to worry about the installation directories for jwsdp. Also, if you plan to
run only on unix, you do not need to worry about setting the windows
installation directory.)</p>
<p align="left">The registry settings, that the tests use, are configured in
registry property files under ${jaxr.test.home}/config/registry-properties.
Please modify these settings as appropriate for your installation. (These
primarily contain the connection properties required for setting up a JAXR
connection)</p>
<h4 align="left"><a name="Design Document">Design Document:</a></h4>
<p align="left">The UML design document for the Service Portal Test Suite can be
found <a href="http://j2ee.east.sun.com/sqe/wspack/jaxr/design/JAXR-TestDesign.sdw">here</a>
(For a PDF version of this StarOffice document, please click <a href="http://j2ee.east.sun.com/sqe/wspack/jaxr/design/JAXR-TestDesign.pdf">here</a>
)</p>
<p align="left">Additionally, there are some tests (e.g regression tests) that
are not included in the Service Portal. However, all the tests are completely
documented. For an explanation of what these tests do, please browse the source
code documentation.</p>
<p align="left"><i><b>Note:</b> Some of the features listed in the ServicePortal
(e.g FederatedQueries ) are not yet supported. These features will be exercised
as they are available in the RI.</i></p>
