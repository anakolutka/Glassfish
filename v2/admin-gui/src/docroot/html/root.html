<a name="root"></a><h3>Java Business Integration</h3><p>Java Business Integration (JBI) is an implementation of the <a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=208">JSR 208 specification for Java Business Integration</a>, a standard developed
under the Java Community Process (JCP) as an approach to implementing a service-oriented
architecture (SOA). </p><p>JBI defines an environment for plug-in components that interact using a services model
based directly on Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 2.0. The plug-in components function
as service providers, service consumers, or both. </p><p>Service Engines are components that provide local services (that is, services within the
JBI environment) and consume local or remote services. Binding Components are proxies for
consumers or providers that are outside the JBI environment. Binding components typically are based
on a standard communications protocol, such as FTP, JMS, or SMTP, or a
call to an external service, such as SAP or WebSphere MQ. </p><p>A Service Assembly is a collection of Service Units that provision target components
that together provide or consume specific services for an application. Service Assemblies are
typically created in a development tools environment, such as that provided by the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment<sup>TM</sup>(NetBeans IDE).
</p><p>A Shared Library provides Java classes that are not private to a single
component and is typically shared by more than one JBI Component. For example,
the Java EE Service Engine requires the WSDL Shared Library.</p><p>From the Admin Console, you can do the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Service Assemblies: View Service Assemblies, manage their lifecycle states, and deploy and undeploy them. For more information, see <a href="deployments.html">Service Assemblies</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>JBI components: View Binding Components and Service Engines, manage their lifecycle states, and install and uninstall them. For more information, see <a href="bindingsengines.html">JBI Components</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared Libraries: View, install and uninstall Shared Libraries. For more information, see <a href="libraries.html">Shared Libraries</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Manage Lifecycle states: For more information, see <a href="jbilifecycle.html">Lifecycle States Within the JBI Environment</a>.</p></li></ul>
