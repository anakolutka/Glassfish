NAME
     disable-http-lb-application  -   disables   an   application
     managed by a load balancer

     application_name target

DESCRIPTION
     This command disables an application for load balancing. The
     disabled  application  goes  offline for load balancing with
     minimal impact to users.  Disabling an application  gives  a
     finer   granularity  of  control  than  disabling  a  server
     instance and is most useful when a cluster is hosting multi-
     ple independent applications.

     Once the application is disabled and the changes  have  been
     applied  to the load balancer, new requests for the applica-
     tion are not forwarded to the target. Existing sessions con-
     tinue  to  access  the  application  until  the  timeout  is
     reached. This process is known as quiescing.

     If an application is deployed across multiple clusters,  use
     this  command  to disable it in one cluster while leaving it
     enabled in others.

     If an application is deployed to a single  server  instance,
     use  this command to disable it in that instance while leav-
     ing the instance itself enabled.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must

                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are

                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --timeout               The timeout  (in  minutes)  to  wait
                             before   disabling   the   specified
                             application. This  time  allows  for
                             the graceful shutdown (quiescing) of
                             the   specified   application.   The
                             default  value  is  30  minutes. The
                             minimum value is 1 minute.

     --name                  The name of the  application  to  be
                             disabled.

OPERANDS
     target                  This operand  specifies  the  server
                             instance or cluster on which to dis-
                             able the application.  Valid  values
                             are:

                               o  cluster_name,  which   disables
                                  the  application  on all server
                                  instances in the cluster.

                               o  stand-alone_instance_name,
                                  which  disables the application
                                  on   the   stand-alone   server
                                  instance.
