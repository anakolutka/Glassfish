NAME
     delete-resource-ref - removes a reference to a resource

SYNOPSIS
     delete-resource-ref
     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]
     [--passwordfile filename] [--help]
     [ --target  target]
     reference_name

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-resource-ref command removes a reference  from  a
     cluster or an unclustered server instance to a resource (for
     example, a JDBC resource). This effectively results  in  the
     removal  of  the resource from the JNDI tree of the targeted
     instance or cluster.

     The target instance or instances making up the cluster  need
     not  be running or available for this command to succeed. If
     one or more instances are not available, they will no longer
     load the resource in the JNDI tree the next time they start.

     Removal of the reference does not result in removal  of  the
     resource  from  the  domain. The resource is removed only by
     the delete command for that resource (for  example,  delete-
     jdbc-resource).

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

Administration Commands                    delete-resource-ref(1)

     -H --host

         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port
         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:8080/admin.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be  specified  by  one  of  the

Administration Commands                    delete-resource-ref(1)

         following means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Specifies the target from which  you  are  removing  the
         resource reference. Valid values are

         server

             Removes the  resource  reference  from  the  default
             server instance server and is the default value.

         cluster_name
             Removes the resource  reference  from  every  server
             instance in the cluster.

         instance_name

             Removes  the  resource  reference  from  the   named
             unclustered server instance.
