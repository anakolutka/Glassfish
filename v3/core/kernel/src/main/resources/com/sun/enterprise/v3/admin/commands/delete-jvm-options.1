     [--terse={true|false}][ --echo={true|false} ]
     [ --interactive={true|false} ] [ --host  host]
     [--port port] [--secure| -s ] [ --user  admin_user]

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-jvm-options command removes JVM options from  the
     Java  configuration  or  profiler elements of the domain.xml
     file.

     Note -

       In the syntax, there can be  more  than  one  JVM  option,
       separated by a colon.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     -H --host
         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port

         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the com-
         mand  runs  successfully  and  the  option  is  silently
         ignored.

     --profiler

         Indicates whether the JVM options are for the  profiler.
         The profiler must exist for this option to be true.

OPERANDS
     jvm_option_name=jvm_option_value
         the left side of the equal sign (=) is  the  JVM  option
         name.  The  right  side of the equal sign (=) is the JVM
         option value. A colon (:) is a  delimiter  for  multiple
         options.

Administration Commands                     delete-jvm-options(1)

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the delete-jvm-options command

     To remove more than one JVM option,  use  a  colon  (:)   to
     separate  the  options.  If the JVM option itself contains a
     colon (:), use the backslash (\fR) to offset the  colon  (:)
     delimiter.

       asadmin> delete-jvm-options -e
       --interactive=true --secure=true --passwordfile passwords.txt
       --terse=false --user admin --target server --host localhost
       --echo=true --port 4848 "-Dtmp=sun"
       Command delete-jvm-options executed successfully

     Where more than one JVM options are deleted.

       asadmin> delete-jvm-options -e -Doption1=value1

       --terse=false --user admin --target server --host localhost
