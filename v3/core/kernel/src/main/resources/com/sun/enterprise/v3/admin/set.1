asadmin Utility Subcommands                                set(1)

NAME
     set - sets the values of configurable attributes

SYNOPSIS
     set
     [--help]
     attribute-name=value

DESCRIPTION
     The set subcommand sets the values of one or more  configur-
     able attributes.

     The set subcommand uses dotted names to  modify  attributes.
     Attributes  from the monitoring hierarchy are read-only, but
     configuration attributes can be modified. You  can  use  the
     list(1)   subcommand   to  display  the  dotted  names  that
     represent individual server components and  subsystems.  For
     example,  a  dotted  name  might be server.applications.web-
     module. After you discover the particular component or  sub-
     system,  you  can  then use the get subcommand to access the
     attributes. For more detailed information on  dotted  names,
     see the dotted-names(5ASC) help page.

     Note -

       On Solaris system, double quotes are needed  when  running
       subcommands  that  use asterisk (*) as the option value or
       operand.

     By modifying attributes, you can  enable  and  disable  ser-
     vices,  and  customize how an existing element functions. An
     asadmin subcommand is provided to update some elements.  For
     example, update-password-alias. However, to update elements,
     you must use the set command. For example, you create a JDBC
     connection  pool  by  using  the create-jdbc-connection-pool
     subcommand. To change attribute settings later, you use  the
     set  command.  Any  change made by using the asadmin utility
     subcommands or the Administration Console are  automatically
     applied  to  the  associated Enterprise Server configuration
     file.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.
