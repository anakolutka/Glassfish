create.http.fail.protocolnotfound=The specified protocol {0} is not yet configured
create.http.listener.duplicate=Http Listener named {0} already exists.
create.http.listener.fail=Listener {0} could not be created, actual reason: {1}
create.http.listener.vs.blank=A default virtual server is required.  Please use --default-virtual-server to specify this value.
create.http.listener.vs.bothparams=--defaultVS and --default-virtual-server conflict.  Please use only --default-virtual-server to specify this value.
create.http.listener.vs.notexists=Attribute value (default-virtual-server = {0}) is not found in list of virtual servers defined in config.
create.http.listener=The create-http-listener command creates an HTTP listener.
