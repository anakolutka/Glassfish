<A NAME="ablat"></A><h3>Application Server Architecture</h3>
<p>This section describes <A HREF="ablaq.html#fwmxm">Figure 1-1</A>, which
shows the high-level architecture of the Application Server.</p>
<A NAME="fwmxm"></A><p><b>Figure 1-1 </b>Application Server Architecture</p>
<IMG src="figures/arch.gif" class="figure"  alt="Figure shows high-level architecture, including containers, services,
tools, and communication with outside systems such as databases." title="Figure shows high-level architecture, including containers, services,
tools, and communication with outside systems such as databases."><ul><li><p><b>Containers</b> - A container <A NAME="indexterm-3"></A>is a runtime environment that provides services such as security and transaction
management to Java 2 EE components. <A HREF="ablaq.html#fwmxm">Figure 1-1</A> shows
the two types of Java 2 EE containers: Web and EJB. Web components, such as JSP pages
and servlets, run within the Web container. Enterprise beans, the components of EJB
technology, run within the EJB container.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Client Access</b> - At runtime,<A NAME="indexterm-4"></A> browser clients access Web applications by communicating with the Web
server via HTTP, the protocol used throughout the internet. The HTTPS protocol is
for applications that require secure communication. Enterprise bean clients communicate
with the Object Request Broker (ORB) through the IIOP or IIOP/SSL (secure) protocols.
The Application Server has separate listeners for the HTTP, HTTPS, IIOP, and IIOP/SSL protocols.
Each listener has exclusive use of a specific port number.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Web Services</b> - On the<A NAME="indexterm-5"></A> Java 2 EE platform, it is possible to deploy a Web application that provides
a Web service implemented by Java API for XML-Based RPC (JAX-RPC). A J2EE application
or component can also be a client to other Web services. Applications access XML registries
through the Java API for XML Registries (JAXR).</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Services for Applications</b> - The
Java 2 EE <A NAME="indexterm-6"></A><A NAME="indexterm-7"></A>platform was designed so that the containers provide services for applications. <A HREF="ablaq.html#fwmxm">Figure 1-1</A> shows the following services:</p>
<ul><li><p>Naming - <A NAME="indexterm-8"></A>A naming and directory<A NAME="indexterm-9"></A> service binds objects to names. A J2EE application locates an object
by looking up its JNDI name. JNDI stands for the Java Naming and Directory Interface
API.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Security - The Java Authorization<A NAME="indexterm-10"></A> Contract for Containers (JACC) is a set of security contracts defined
for the J2EE containers. Based on the client's identity, the containers restrict
access to the container's resources and services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><b>Transaction management</b> - A <A NAME="indexterm-11"></A>transaction is an indivisible unit of work. For example, transferring
funds between bank accounts is a transaction. A transaction management service ensures
that a transaction either completes fully or is rolled back.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablau"></A><h4>Access to External Systems</h4>
<p>The Java 2 EE platform enables applications to access systems that are outside
of the application server. Applications connect to these systems through objects called
resources. One of the responsibilities of an administrator is resource configuration.
The Java 2 EE platform enables access to external systems through the following APIs
and components:</p>
<ul><li><p><b>JDBC</b> - A database management<A NAME="indexterm-12"></A> system (DBMS) provides facilities for storing, organizing, and retrieving
data. Most business applications store data in relational databases, which applications
access via the JDBC API. The information in databases is often described as persistent
because it is saved on disk and exists after the application ends. The Application Server bundle
includes the PointBase DBMS.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Messaging</b> - Messaging<A NAME="indexterm-13"></A> is a method of communication between software components or applications.
A messaging client sends messages to, and receives messages from, any other client.
Applications access the messaging provider through the Java Messaging Service (JMS)
API. The Application Server includes a JMS provider.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Connector</b> - The J2EE <A NAME="indexterm-14"></A>Connector architecture enables integration between J2EE applications and
existing Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). An application accesses an EIS through
a portable J2EE component called a connector or resource adapter.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>JavaMail</b> - Through<A NAME="indexterm-15"></A> the JavaMail API, applications connect to an SMTP server in order to
send and receive email.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Server Administration</b> -The <A NAME="indexterm-16"></A>lower right-hand corner of Figure 1-1 shows some of the tasks performed
by the administrator of the Application Server. For example, an administrator deploys (installs)
applications and monitors the server's performance. These tasks are performed
with the administration tools provided by the Application Server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablav"></A><h3>Tools for Administration</h3>
<ul><li><p>The Application Server includes three administrative tools:</p>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablaw">Admin Console</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablax">asadmin Utility</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablay">Application Server Management Extension (AMX)</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablaw"></A><h4>Admin Console</h4>
<p>The Admin Console is<A NAME="indexterm-17"></A> a browser-based tool that features an easy-to-navigate interface and
online help. The administration server must be running to use the Admin Console.</p>
<p>When the Application Server was installed, you chose a port number for the server,
or used the default port of 4848. You also specified a user name and master password.</p>
<p>To start the Admin Console, in a web browser type:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>http://<tt>hostname</tt>:<tt>port</tt></pre>
</td></table><br><p>For example:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>http://kindness.sun.com:4848</pre>
</td></table><br><p>If the Admin Console is running on the machine on which the Application Server was
installed, specify <tt>localhost</tt> for the host name.</p>
<p>On Windows, start the Application Server Admin Console from the Start menu.</p>
<p>The installation program creates the default administrative domain (named <tt>domain1</tt>) with the default port number <tt>4848</tt>, as well as
an instance separate from the domain administration server (DAS). After installation,
additional administration domains can be created. Each domain has its own domain administration
server, which has a unique port number. When specifying the URL for the Admin Console,
be sure to use the port number for the domain to be administered.</p>
<A NAME="ablax"></A><h4>asadmin Utility</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-18"></A><A NAME="indexterm-19"></A>The <tt>asadmin</tt> utility is a command-line tool. Use the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility and the commands associated with it to perform the same
set of tasks that can be performed in the Admin Console. For example, start and stop
domains, configure the server, and deploy applications.</p>
<p>Use these commands either from a command prompt in the shell, or call them from
other scripts and programs. Use these commands to automate repetitive administration
tasks.</p>
<p>To start the <tt>asadmin</tt> utility:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin</pre>
</td></table><br><p>To list the commands available within <tt>asadmin</tt>:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>asadmin> help</pre>
</td></table><br><p>It is also possible to issue an <tt>asadmin</tt> command at the shell's
command prompt:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin help</pre>
</td></table><br><p>To view a command's syntax and examples, type <tt>help</tt> followed
by the command name. For example:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>asadmin> help create-jdbc-resource</pre>
</td></table><br><p>The <tt>asadmin help</tt> information for a given command displays
the UNIX man page of the command. These man pages are also available in HTML format.</p>
<A NAME="ablay"></A><h4>Application Server Management Extension (AMX)</h4>
<p>The <b>A</b>pplication Server <b>M</b>anagement e<b>X</b>tension is an API that
exposes all of the Application Server configuration and monitoring JMX managed beans as
easy-to-use client-side dynamic proxies implementing the AMX interfaces.</p>
<p>For more information on using the Application Server Management Extension, see the
JMX chapter in the <i>Application Server Developer's Guide</i>.</p>
<A NAME="gbthc"></A><h2>About the Administration Console</h2>
<p>The Application Server Admin Console is a Web browser-based, graphical user interface
that you use to manage the application server domain. An Application Server domain is a
logically related group of Application Server resources that you manage as a unit. A domain
includes one or more Application Servers. You deploy and manage your applications as part
of a domain.</p>
<p>One instance of the Application Server in the domain is configured as a Domain Administration
Server (DAS). The Domain Administration Server provides a central point for managing
an Application Server domain. In a domain with only a single Application Server instance, that
server functions both a Domain Administration Server and the management server. The
Domain Administration Server hosts the Administration Console, which is a Web application
accessible from any supported Web browser with network access to the Administration
Server. </p>
<p>Use the Administration Console to: </p>
<ul><li><p>Configure, start, and stop Application Server instances</p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure Application Server services, such as database connectivity (JDBC)
and messaging (JMS)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure security parameters, including managing users, groups, and
roles</p>
</li>
<li><p>Configure and deploy your applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monitor server and application performance</p>
</li>
<li><p>View server and domain log files</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="fxbix"></A><h3>Using Online Help</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-20"></A>The Admin Console's online help is context-sensitive: When clicking
the Help link in the upper right corner, the help browser window displays a topic
related to the current Admin Console page. </p>
<p>The online help includes conceptual topics that are not context-sensitive. To
view one of these topics, select it from the table of contents in the help browser
window.</p>
<A NAME="ablaz"></A><h2>Application Server Configuration</h2>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablba">Configuring the Application Server</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablba"></A><h3>Configuring the Application Server</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-21"></A>Application Server domains are logical or physical units created to help the
administrator manage a system configuration. A domain is broken down into smaller
units including instances. A server instance is a single Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
that runs the Application Server on a single physical machine. Each domain has one or more
instance. </p>
<A NAME="ablbc"></A><h3>Creating a Domain</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-22"></A><p><A NAME="indexterm-23"></A>Domains are created using the <tt>create-domain</tt> command.
The following example command creates a domain named <tt>mydomain</tt>.
The administration server listens on port 1234 and the administrative user name is <tt>admin</tt>. The command prompts for the administrative and master passwords.</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin create-domain --adminport 80 --adminuser admin mydomain</pre>
</td></table><br><p>To start the Admin Console for <tt>mydomain</tt> domain, in a browser,
enter the following URL:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>http://<i>hostname</i>:80</pre>
</td></table><br><p>For the preceding <tt>create-domain</tt> example, the domain's
log files, configuration files, and deployed applications now reside in the following
directory:</p>
<p><i>domain-root-dir</i><tt>/mydomain</tt></p>
<p>To create the domain's directory in another location, specify the <tt>--domaindir</tt> option. For the full syntax of the command, type <tt>asadmin
help create-domain</tt>.</p>
<A NAME="ablbd"></A><h3>Deleting a Domain</h3>
<p>Domains are deleted using the <tt>asadmin delete-domain</tt> <A NAME="indexterm-24"></A>command. Only the operating system user (or root) who can administer the
domain can execute this command successfully. To delete a domain named <tt>mydomain</tt>, for example, type the following command:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin delete-domain mydomain</pre>
</td></table><br><A NAME="ablbe"></A><h3>Listing Domains</h3>
<p>The domains created on a machine can be found using the <tt>asadmin list-domains</tt> <A NAME="indexterm-25"></A> command. To list the domains in the default <i>domain-root-dir</i> directory,
type this command:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin list-domains</pre>
</td></table><br><p>To list domains that were created in other directories, specify the <tt>--domaindir</tt> option.</p>
<A NAME="ablbf"></A><h3>Starting the Domain</h3>
<p>When starting a domain, the administration server and application server instance
are started. Once the application server instance is started it runs constantly, listening
for and accepting requests.</p>
<p>To start a domain, type the <tt>asadmin start-domain</tt> <A NAME="indexterm-26"></A> command and specify the domain name. For example, to start the default
domain (<tt>domain1</tt>), type the following:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin start-domain --user admin domain1</pre>
</td></table><br><p>For the full command syntax, type <tt>asadmin help start-domain</tt>.
If the password data is omitted, you are prompted to supply it.</p>
<A NAME="ablbg"></A><h4>On Windows, to start the default domain:</h4>
<p>From the Windows Start Menu, select Programs -> Sun Microsystems -> Application Server ->
Start Admin Server.</p>
<A NAME="ablbi"></A><h3>Stopping the Domain</h3>
<p>Stopping a domain shuts down its administration server and application server
instance. When stopping a domain, the server instance stops accepting new connections
and then waits for all outstanding connections to complete. This process takes a few
seconds because the server instance must complete its shutdown process. While the
domain is stopped, the Admin Console or most <tt>asadmin</tt> commands
cannot be used.</p>
<p>To stop a domain, type the <tt>asadmin stop-domain</tt> <A NAME="indexterm-27"></A> command and specify the domain name. For example, to stop the default
domain (<tt>domain1</tt>), type the following:</p>
<table cellpadding="4" border="1" cols="1" width="100%"><td><pre>$ asadmin stop-domain domain1</pre>
</td></table><br><p>If there is only one domain, then the domain name is optional. For the full
syntax, type <tt>asadmin help stop-domain</tt>.</p>
<A NAME="ablbk"></A><h4>On Windows, to stop the default domain:</h4>
<p>From the Start menu select Programs -> Sun Microsystems -> Application Server-> Stop
Admin Server.</p>
<A NAME="ablbn"></A><h2>Application Server Instances</h2>

</li>
<li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablbp"><i></i>Defining Application Server Instances</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablcd">Recovering Transactions</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablbo"></A><h3>About Application Server Instances</h3>
<p>The Application Server creates one application server instance, called <tt>server</tt> at the time of installation. You can delete the server instance and
create a new instance with a different name if you prefer.</p>
<p>Each Application Server instance has its own Java 2 EE configuration, Java 2 EE resources,
application deployment areas, and server configuration settings. Changes to one application
server instance have no effect on other application server instances. You can have
many application server instances within one administrative domain.</p>
<p>For many users, one application server instance meets their needs. However,
depending upon your environment, you might want to create one or more additional application
server instances. For example, in a development environment you can use different
application server instances to test different Application Server configurations, or to
compare and test different application deployments. Because you can easily add or
delete an application server instance, you can use them to create temporary "sandbox"
areas to experiment with while developing.</p>
<p>In addition, for each application server instance you can also create virtual
servers. Within a single installed application server instance you can offer companies
or individuals domain names, IP Addresses, and some administration capabilities. For
the users, it is almost as if they have their own web server, without the hardware
and basic server maintenance. These virtual servers do not span application server
instances. For more information about virtual servers, see the Java Virtual Machine
chapter of the Administration Guide.</p>
<p>In operational deployments, for many purposes you can use virtual servers instead
of multiple application server instances. However, if virtual servers do not meet
your needs, you can also use multiple application server instances.</p>
<p>An Application Server instance is not started automatically. Once you start an instance,
the instance runs until you stop it. When you stop an application server instance,
it stops accepting new connections, then waits for all outstanding connections to
complete. If your machine crashes or is taken offline, the server quits and any requests
it was servicing may be lost.</p>
<A NAME="ablbp"></A><h3><b></b>Defining Application Server Instances</h3>
<A NAME="indexterm-28"></A><p>Application server instances form the basis of an application deployment. Each
instance belongs to a single domain and has its own directory structure, configuration,
and deployed applications. Each server instance also includes the J2EE platform web
and EJB containers. Every new server instance must contain a reference to a node agent
name defining the machine on which the instance will reside.</p>
<p>There are two types of server instances that can be created. Each server instance
can only be of one type:</p>
<ul><li><p>In the <b>stand-alone server</b> instance
the configuration is not shared by any other server instance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <b>shared server instance</b> the
configuration is shared with other instances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><A HREF="ablaq.html#fwmxk">Figure 1-2</A> shows an application server
instance in detail. The application server instance is a building block in the clustering,
load balancing, and session persistence features of the Application Server Enterprise Edition.</p>
<A NAME="fwmxk"></A><p><b>Figure 1-2 </b>Application Server Instance</p>
<IMG src="figures/app-serv-deploy.gif" class="figure"  alt="Figure shows server instance features and how they communicate
with various clients, databases, and other servers and systems." title="Figure shows server instance features and how they communicate
with various clients, databases, and other servers and systems."><A NAME="ablcd"></A><h3>Recovering Transactions</h3>
<p>Transactions might be incomplete either because the server crashed or a resource
manager crashed. It is essential to complete these stranded transactions and recover
from the failures. Application Server is designed to recover from these failures and complete
the transactions upon server startup.</p>
<p>If the selected server is running, then recovery will be done by the same server.
If the selected server is not running, then the selected Destination Server will do
the recovery.</p>
<A NAME="ablcg"></A><h2>Configuration Changes</h2>
<ul><li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablch">Changing Application Server Configuration</A></p>
</li>
<li><p><A HREF="ablaq.html#ablci">Ports in the Application Server</A></p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ablch"></A><h3>Changing Application Server Configuration</h3>
<p>When making any of these configuration changes, restart the server for the changes
to take effect:</p>
<ul><li><p>Changing JVM options</p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing port numbers</p>
</li>
<li><p>Managing HTTP, IIOP, and JMS services</p>
</li>
<li><p>Managing thread pools</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With dynamic configuration, most changes take effect while the server is running.
To make the following configuration changes, do <i>NOT</i> restart the
server:</p>
<ul><li><p>Deploying and undeploying applications</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding or removing JDBC, JMS, and Connector resources and pools</p>
</li>
