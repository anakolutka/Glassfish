asadmin Utility Subcommands                    delete-profiler(1)

NAME
     delete-profiler - removes the specified profiler element

SYNOPSIS
     delete-profiler
     [--help]
     [ --target  target_name]

DESCRIPTION
     The delete-profilercommand deletes the profiler element  you
     specify.  A server instance is tied to a particular profiler
     by the profiler element in the Java configuration.  Changing
     a profiler requires you to restart the server.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
