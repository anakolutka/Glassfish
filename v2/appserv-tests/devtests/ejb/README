** Make sure the glassfish installation bin/appclient script has execute permissions before running.  **

1. Run step 2) of general appserv-tests framework configuration
in appserv-tests/QuickLook-README.txt.   

2. Make sure ant is in your path.  Also, in some cases the ant test 
clients run out of memory during the test run.  If you see this problem,
add -Xmx999m to the command that starts the ant java vm, e.g :

cat `which ant` :


(... towards bottom of ant script)

 "$JAVACMD" -Xmx999m -classpath "$LOCALCLASSPATH" -Dant.home="${ANT_HOME}" $ANT_OPTS org.apache.tools.ant.Main $ANT_ARGS "$@"

3. Start the app server. 

  % asadmin start-domain

4. Run all the tests

  % ant all

5. Stop the app server

  % asadmin stop-domain
