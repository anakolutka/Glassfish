     directory

     list-domains    [--domaindir    install_dir/domains]     [--

DESCRIPTION
     Use the list-domains command to list  the  domain.   If  the
     domain directory is not specified, the domain in the default
     install_dir/domains directory is listed. If  there  is  more
     that one domain, the domain_name operand must be identified.

                             to  be  started.  If  specified, the

                             filesystem.  If  not  specified, the
                             domain      in      the      default
                             install_dir/domains   directory   is
                             started.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on to the stan-
