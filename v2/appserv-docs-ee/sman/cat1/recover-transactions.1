DESCRIPTION
     The function of this command is to manually recover  pending
     transactions.  This is used in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The  authorized  domain  application
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          The name of the file containing  the
                             domain  application server password.
                             The  passwordfile   should   contain
                             either  of  the  following  entries:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password        or
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD=password. If
                             this option is not called  directly,
                             you  will  be prompted for it before
                             the requested action is completed.

     -H.--host               The  machine  name  where  the   the
                             domain  application  server  is run-
                             ning.

     -p.--port               The port number of the domain appli-
                             cation server listening for adminis-
                             tration requests.

     -s.--secure             If set to true,  this  command  uses
                             SSL/TLS   to  communicate  with  the

                             domain application server.

     -t.--terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a  script.  The  default  is
                             false.

     -e.--echo               Setting this  option  to  true  will
                             echo  the  command line statement on
                             the standard output. The default  is
                             false.

     -I.--interactive        If  this  option  is  set  to   true
                             (default),  only  the required pass-
                             word options are prompted.

     --delegatedrecovery     When the delegated-recovery  is  set
                             to  false (the default), transaction
                             recovery  is  done  at  the  running
                             server.  When the delegated-recovery
                             is set to true, another server  per-
                             forms  the  recovery  for the failed
                             server.  If the command  is  set  to
                             true  and there is no server-related
                             data, the  DAS  does  the  delegated
                             recovery.

     --transactionlogdir     When a server fails  it  writes  the
                             location  in  its  transaction  log.
                             This  option  is  required  if   the
                             -delegetedrecovery  option is set to
                             true. If the failed  server's  tran-
                             saction  logs  are  copied  to  some
                             other location to make it  available
                             to  the  surrogate  recovery server,
                             this option should be used.  If  the
                             failed server's transaction-service,
                             tx-log-dir is modified to reflect  a
                             new  location,  then  this option is
                             not required.

     --recoveryserverid      This option is the server  identifi-
                             cation  id  or  token for the failed
                             server. This option is  required  if
                             the  -delegaterecovery option is set
                             to true. This option is  not  neces-
                             sary   if  the  recovery_server_name
                             operand  can  giv  a  hint  of   the
                             recovery_server_id. The recoveryser-
                             verid option is  not  only  used  in
                             recovery  but it is also used in the
                             creation of the XIDand later used to
                             recognize  the  XIDs  that belong to
                             this server.

OPERANDS
     recovery_server_name    This is the name of the server  that
                             failed.  It  is  this server that is
                             losting the transaction that will be
                             recovered.
