<a name="threadpools"></a><h3>Thread Pools</h3>
<p>This section describes thread pools and how they work in the Application
Server.</p><p>The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can support many threads of execution at
once. To help performance, the Application Server maintains one or more thread
pools. It is possible to assign specific thread pools to connector modules
and to the ORB.</p><p>One thread pool can serve multiple connector modules and enterprise beans. Request
threads handle user requests for application components. When the server receives a
request, it assigns the request to a free thread from the thread
pool. The thread executes the client's requests and returns results. For example, if
the request needs to use a system resource that is currently busy,
the thread waits until that resource is free before allowing the request
to use that resource.</p><p>Specify the minimum and maximum number of threads that are reserved for
requests from applications. The thread pool is dynamically adjusted between these two
values. The minimum thread pool size that is specified signals the server
to allocate at least that many threads in reserve for application requests. That
number is increased up to the maximum thread pool size that is
specified.</p><p>Increasing the number of threads available to a process allows the process
to respond to more application requests simultaneously.</p><p><a name="indexterm-287"></a>Avoid thread starvation, where one resource adapter or application occupies all threads
in the Application Server, by dividing the Application Server threads into different
thread-pools.</p>
