<h4>2.1 Idea1 --- Feb 2006<a name="idea1"></a></h4>
<p>One of the main strengths of today's build is it is developer friendly once 
  the base build from the top-level module is done. Once the user does maven checkout 
  bootstrap-all build configure-runtime, a runtime (appserver domain) that uses 
  the build is ready to go. </p>
<p>The top level build is shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="images/gf-build-jan-2006.jpg" width="767" height="1012"></p>
<p>Here is the most frequent scenario after the user does the build and runtime 
  configuration <i>once</i>. </p>
<ol>
  <li>I want to change my code in module foo.</li>
  <li>cd glassfish/foo</li>
  <li>change code</li>
  <li>maven build</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, user just has to restart the GlassFish Server by doing asadmin 
  stop-domain and start-domain.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p><b>A problem perceived by many developers is the update of the mammoth appserv-rt.jar 
  (which contains most of the appserver's runtime classes/interfaces) during the 
  build process.</b></p>
<p>The idea to improve here is to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Build the sources from top-level once. The build process is separated from 
    the assembly process. Thus the top level build will first call build on all 
    the modules. Then, the assembly will be done explicitly.</li>
  <li>Each module's build used to do the assembly in the same &quot;build&quot; 
    target. This will change.</li>
  <li>Each module's build only builds the classes in &lt;module-dir&gt;/build 
    and copies those classes to ${GF_ROOT}/lib/classes</li>
  <li>The top-level call to the build will be something like &quot;build-but-don't-copy&quot; 
    so that the top-level build never creates any classes in lib/classes.</li>
  <li>During the configure-rutime goal, we only add &quot;${com.sun.aas.installRoot}/lib/classes&quot; 
    to the classpath-prefix of appserver VM. This way, classes built by the developers 
    take the precedence over the other versions of the same classes in say appserv-rt.jar.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/gf-build-after-jan-2006.jpg" width="767" height="1012"></p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No change to the nightly build. In general, no major change.</li>
  <li>If the developer wants to be absolutely sure, they just do &quot;maven clean 
    clobber bootstrap build configure-runtime&quot; from glassfish/bootstrap. 
    When the developer does this, it will <i>not</i> generate the temporary lib/classes 
    directory and hence it will mimic a clean product build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A slight disadvantage is copying of classes to two locations upon building 
    it from separate modules. But that's OK and safe, I think.</li>
</ul>
