This devtest tries to test whether the appserver
destroys the connection when it is marked as bad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
test1() READONLY Operation with db
Pool - Steady, max-pool-size : 1
Tx Attribute "Required"
ejb-descriptor - "Shareable"

Client will call test1() to get the "hashcode" of physical connection.
Client will call test1() again and if the values of physical connection in first & second
call differ, test is passed.

test2()  WRITE Operation with db
Pool - Steady, max-pool-size : 1
Tx Attribute "Required"
ejb-descriptor - "Shareable"
