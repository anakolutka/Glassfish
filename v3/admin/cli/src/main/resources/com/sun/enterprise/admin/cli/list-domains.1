NAME
     list-domains - lists the domains  in  the  specified  domain
     directory

SYNOPSIS
     list-domains  [--domaindir install-dir/domains]
     [--terse=false] [--echo=false]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the list-domains command to  list  the  domain.  If  the
     domain directory is not specified, the domain in the default
     install-dir/domains directory is listed. If  there  is  more
     that one domain, the domain_name operand must be identified.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir

         The directory where the domains are to  be  started.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem.  If  not  specified,  the  domain  in  the  default
         install-dir/domains directory is started.

     -t --terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         to the standard output. Default is false.

EXAMPLES

       sampleDomain not running
       Command list-domains executed successfully

     Where: domain1 and sampleDomain are the domains  located  in
     the default install-dir/domains directory.
