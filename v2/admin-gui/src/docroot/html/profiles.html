<a name="profiles"></a><h4>Application Server Profiles</h4>
<p>Since the Admin Console displays the administrative domain, the interface is dependent on
the usage profile selected. Every administrative domain is associated with a usage profile
that identifies the capabilities of that domain. The Application Server provides the following
profiles:</p><dl><dt>Developer</dt>
<dd><p>Use this profile if the domain is running in a development environment and if the applications being developed do not need the NSS keystore or clustering features, such as load balancing, and session persistence.</p></dd>
<dt>Cluster</dt>
<dd><p> Use this profile to create clusters that do not require the high-availability database (HADB) or the NSS keystore.</p></dd>
<dt>Enterprise</dt>
<dd><p> Use this profile to take advantage of the High Availability Database (HADB) and NSS keystore features. This profile is available only if the HADB and NSS are installed separately or if the Application Server was installed as part of the Java Enterprise System (JES).</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>If you create a domain without specifying the profile, the profile with which
the domain is created is determined by the value of the <tt>AS_ADMIN_PROFILE</tt>
variable in the <tt>asadminenv.conf</tt> file. The default value of the <tt>AS_ADMIN_PROFILE</tt> variable depends
on the distribution of Application Server from which the Application Server was installed.</p><p>The domain provides a preconfigured runtime for the user applications. Usage profiles facilitate
the distinction between the Application Server binaries and the runtime configuration. Use the
same installation of Application Server to create different domains with profiles that suit
specific needs. For example, a developer may want to use the Application Server
to get to know the latest Java EE specifications. This developer does not
need stringent security settings. Another user who wants to deploy applications in a
production environment needs an inherently secure environment.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note - </b>Some topics in the Admin Console Online Help pertain to features that are
available only in domains that are configured to support clusters. Examples of domains
that support clusters are domains that are created with the cluster profile or the
enterprise profile. If your domain is not configured to support clustering, and you
require to use clustering features of Application Server, add cluster support. For more
information, see <a href="upgradeprofile.html">To Add Cluster Support to a Domain</a>.</p>
