Package Contents:

org.glassfish.synchronization.central - 
---------------------------------------
This package has the classes which are specific to the central server which 
is the source of the synchronization process. Included in this package is the 
Grizzly adapter specific to the central server, the Limit Balancer specific to
the central server and the "Main" which is responsible, currently, for starting
a new instance of grizzly server. Also included is a ping utility which pings
all completed instances to verify they are still running.

org.glassfish.synchronization.client - 
---------------------------------------
As labeled the client package includes all the classes which are in charge 
of synchronizing the glassfish instances.  This package also includes, however,
the classes which are intended to "mimic" v2 synchronization behavior. These
are labeld with V2 in the class name to signify. 

org.glassfish.synchronization.filemanagement - 
-----------------------------------------------
The file management package contains the packages which are in charge of file
management in terms of recieving new files and creating zip files to serve
to connected child nodes.  The major function included in this package is the 
file caching which is also handled by the classes in this package.

org.glassfish.synchronization.loadbalancer - 
-----------------------------------------------
The loadbalancer package contains the load balancing utilities and different
load balancers.  

org.glassfish.synchronization.manifest - 
-----------------------------------------------
This package includes the manifest manager and a download manager. This package
tracks what pieces of the manifest have been received and what is still needed,
while maintaining the manifest.

org.glassfish.synchronization.message - 
-----------------------------------------------
This class contains all the message classes which are passed back and forth 
during synchronization.

org.glassfish.synchronization.util - 
-----------------------------------------------
This package contains the classes which are helper classes for the most part.
These include the cookie manager and file/zip utilities.  Many of these classes
are those that are passed around in the SyncContext object which is passed 
around as well. 

test- 
-----------------------------------------------
The test class is as it sounds and should be removed in production.  This class
includes the starter classes which start the sync servers and also some older
deprecated classes.
