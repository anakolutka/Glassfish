     load balancer

     filename]  [--host localhost] [--port 4849] [--secure|-s] [-
     -terse=false] [--echo=false]  [--interactive=true]  [--help]

     (name=value)[:name=value]*] --target target |  config_name

DESCRIPTION
     Use the  create-http-lb-config  command  to  create  a  load
     balancer  configuration.  This configuration applies to load
     balancing in the HTTP path.  After  using  this  command  to
     create the load balancer configuration file, create the load
     balancer by running create-http-lb.

     You must specify either a target or a configuration name, or
     both.  If  you  don't specify a target, the configuration is
     created without  a  target  and  you  add  one  later  using
     create-http-lb-ref  If  you  don't  specify  a configuration
     name, a name is created based on the target  name.   If  you
     specify  both,  the configuration is created with the speci-
     fied name, referencing the specified target.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:

                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The  port  number  of   the   domain
                             administration  server listening for
                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -h --help               Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --responsetimeout       The time in seconds within  which  a
                             server   instance   must   return  a
                             response. If no response is received
                             within  the  time period, the server
                             is considered unhealthy. If set to a
                             positive  number, and the request is
                             idempotent, the request is  retried.
                             If the request is not idempotent, an
                             error page is returned. If set to  0
                             no  timeout  is used. The default is
                             60.

     --httpsrouting          If set to true,  HTTPS  requests  to
                             the  load  balancer  result in HTTPS
                             requests to the server instance.  If
                             set  to false, HTTPS requests to the
                             load   balancer   result   in   HTTP
                             requests to the server instance. The
                             default is false.

     --reloadinterval        The  interval  between  checks   for
                             changes  to the load balancer confi-
                             guration file loadbalancer.xml. When
                             the  check detects changes, the con-
                             figuration file is reloaded. A value
                             of 0 disables reloading.

     --monitor               Specifies  whether   monitoring   is
                             enabled. The default is false.

     --routecookie           This option is deprecated. The value
                             is always true.

     --property              Optional attribute name/value  pairs
                             for configuring the load balancer.

     ---target               Specifies the target  to  which  the
                             load balancer configuration applies.
                             If you don't specify a  target,  the
                             load   balancer   configuration   is

                             created without a  target.  You  can
                             specify targets later using the com-
                             mand create-http-lb-ref.

                             Valid values are:

                               o  cluster_name,  which  specifies
                                  that  requests for this cluster
                                  will be  handled  by  the  load
                                  balancer.

                               o  stand-alone_instance_name,
                                  which  specifies  that requests
                                  for this  stand-alone  instance
                                  will  be  handled  by  the load
                                  balancer.

OPERANDS
     config_name             The name of the  new  load  balancer
                             configuration.  This  name  must not
                             conflict   with   any   other   load
                             balancer  groups, agents, configura-
                             tions, clusters, or sever  instances
                             in  the domain. If you don't specify
                             a name, the load balancer configura-
                             tion  name  is  based  on the target
                             name, target_name-http-lb-config.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using the create-http-lb-config command

     mylbconfigname

EXIT STATUS
     0                       command executed successfully

     1                       error in executing the command
