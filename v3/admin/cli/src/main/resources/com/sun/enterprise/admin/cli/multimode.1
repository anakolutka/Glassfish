asadmin Utility Subcommands                          multimode(1)

NAME
     multimode - allows you to execute  multiple  commands  while
     preserving environment settings and remaining in the asadmin
     utility

SYNOPSIS
     multimode   [--file filename] [--printprompt={true|false}] [ --encoding  encode]
     [--terse={false|true}] [ --echo={false|true} ]

DESCRIPTION
     Use multimode to process the asadmin commands. The  command-
     line  interface  will prompt you for a command, execute that
     command, display the results of the command, and then prompt
     you  for  the  next  command.  Additionally, all the asadmin
     option names set in this mode are used for  all  the  subse-
     quent  commands.  You  can set your environment and run com-
     mands until you exit multimode by typing exit or  quit.  You
     can  also  provide commands by passing a previously prepared
     list of commands from a file or standard input  (pipe).  You
     can  invoke  multimode from within a multimode session; once
     you exit the second multimode  environment,  you  return  to
     your original multimode environment.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --file

         Reads the commands as defined in the file.

     --printprompt
         Allows the printing of the  asadmin  prompt  after  each
         command  is  executed. Set this option to false when the
         commands are piped or redirected from the standard input
         or file. By default the option is set to true.

     --encoding

         Specifies the locale for the file to be decoded.

     --terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.
