OPTIONS
     -t --terse                      Indicates  that  any  output
                                     data  must  be very concise,
                                     typically  avoiding   human-
                                     friendly    sentences    and
                                     favoring well-formatted data
                                     for consumption by a script.
                                     Default is false.

     -e --echo                       Setting to  true  will  echo
                                     the  command  line statement
                                     on  the   standard   output.
                                     Default is false.

     -I --interactive                If set  to  true  (default),
                                     only  the  required password
                                     options are prompted.

     -H --host                       The machine name  where  the
                                     domain administration server
                                     is  running.   The   default
                                     value is localhost.

     -p --port                       The HTTP/S port for adminis-
                                     tration. This is the port to
                                     which you should point  your
                                     browser  in  order to manage
                                     the  domain.   For  example,
                                     http://localhost:4848.

                                     The default port  number  is
                                     4848.

     -s --secure                     If set to true, uses SSL/TLS
                                     to   communicate   with  the
                                     domain        administration
                                     server.

     -u --user                       The    authorized     domain
                                     administration server admin-
                                     istrative username.

                                     If you have authenticated to
                                     a  domain  using the asadmin
                                     login command, then you need
                                     not   specify   the   --user
                                     option on subsequent  opera-
                                     tions   to  this  particular
                                     domain.

     --passwordfile                  The  --passwordfile   option
                                     specifies the name of a file
                                     containing   the    password
                                     entries  in  a specific for-
                                     mat. The entry for the pass-
                                     word must have the AS_ADMIN_
                                     prefix followed by the pass-
                                     word   name   in   uppercase
                                     letters.

                                     For example, to specify  the
                                     domain administration server
                                     password, use an entry  with
                                     the     following    format:
                                     AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,
                                     where password is the actual
                                     administrator      password.
                                     Other  passwords that can be
                                     specified            include
                                     AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                                     AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,   and
                                     AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                                     All  remote  commands   must
                                     specify  the  admin password
                                     to   authenticate   to   the

                                     domain        administration
                                     server,  either  through  --
                                     passwordfile    or   asadmin
                                     login, or  interactively  on
                                     the   command   prompt.  The
                                     asadmin login command can be
                                     used  only  to  specify  the
                                     admin  password.  For  other
                                     passwords,   that   must  be
                                     specified  for  remote  com-
                                     mands,     use     the    --
                                     passwordfile or  enter  them
                                     at the command prompt.

                                     If you have authenticated to
                                     a  domain  using the asadmin
                                     login command, then you need
                                     not  specify the admin pass-
                                     word    through    the    --
                                     passwordfile  option on sub-
                                     sequent operations  to  this
                                     particular  domain. However,
                                     this is applicable  only  to
                                     AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD    option.
                                     You will still need to  pro-
                                     vide  the  other  passwords,
                                     for                 example,
                                     AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,    as
                                     and when required by indivi-
                                     dual   commands,   such   as
                                     update-file-user.

                                     For security reasons,  pass-
                                     words    specified   as   an
                                     environment  variable   will
                                     not be read by asadmin.

                                     The   default   value    for
                                     AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
                                     changeit.
