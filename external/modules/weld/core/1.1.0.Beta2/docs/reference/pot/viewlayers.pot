If a new page is created and set as the response target through <literal>setResponsePage()</literal>, this new page will also participate in this conversation. This occurs for both directly instantiated pages (<literal>setResponsePage(new OtherPage())</literal>), as well as for bookmarkable pages created with <literal>setResponsePage(OtherPage.class)</literal> where <literal>OtherPage.class</literal> is mounted as bookmarkable from your <literal>WebApplication</literal> subclass (or through annotations). In the latter case, because the new page instance is not created until after a redirect, the conversation id will be propagated through a request parameter, and then stored in page metadata after the redirect."
