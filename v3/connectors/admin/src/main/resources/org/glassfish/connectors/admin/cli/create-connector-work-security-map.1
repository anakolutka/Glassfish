DESCRIPTION
     You can use this command to map the caller identity  of  the
     work  submitted by the resource adapter EIS principal or EIS
     user group to a suitable principal  or  user  group  in  the
     application  server  security domain. One or more work secu-
     rity maps may be associated with  a  resource  adapter.  The
     connector  work  security map configuration supports the use
     of the wild card asterisk (*) to indicate all users  or  all
     user groups.

     The enterprise information system (EIS) is any  system  that
     holds  the data of an organization. It can be a mainframe, a
     messaging system, a database system, or an application.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t --terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         If set to true, the command-line statement is echoed  on
         the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive

         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

Administration Commands     create-connector-work-security-map(1)

     -H --host

         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port
         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This
         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -s --secure

         If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to  communicate  with  the
         domain administration server.

         The default is false.

     -u --user
         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile

         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The entry for a password must have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix
         followed  by the password name in uppercase letters. For
         example, to specify the password for the domain adminis-
         tration server, use an entry with the following format:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         In this example, password is  the  actual  administrator
         password.

         The following other passwords can also be specified:

             o    AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD

             o    AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD

Administration Commands     create-connector-work-security-map(1)

             o    AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD
         All remote  commands  must  specify  the  administration
         password  to  authenticate  to the domain administration
         server. The password can be specified by one of the fol-
         lowing means:

             o    Through the --passwordfile option

             o    Through the asadmin login command

             o    Interactively at the command prompt
         The asadmin login command can be used  only  to  specify
         the  administration  password.  For other passwords that
         remote commands require, use the  --passwordfile  option
         or specify them at the command prompt.

         After authenticating to a domain by  using  the  asadmin
         login  command,  you need not specify the administration
         password through the --passwordfile  option  for  subse-
         quent  operations  on  the  domain.  However,  only  the
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD option is not required. You still must
         provide    the    other    passwords,    for    example,
         AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, when required by individual  com-
         mands, such as update-file-user.

         For security reasons, a password that is specified as an
         environment variable is not read by the asadmin command.

         The  default  value   for   AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD   is
         changeit.

     --help

         Displays the help text for the command.

     --raname
         Indicates the connector module name, which is  the  name
         of the resource adapter in the domain.xml file.

     --principalsmap

         Specifies a map of the back-end  EIS  principal  to  the
         application server principal. Use a comma-separated list
         to specify more than one  mapping.  Use  either  the  --
         principalsmap  option or the --groupsmap option, but not
         both.

     --groupsmap

         Specifies a map of the back-end EIS user  group  to  the
         application  server  user  group.  Use a comma-separated
         list to specify more than one mapping.  Use  either  the
         --principalsmap  option  or  the --groupsmap option, but
         not both.

     --description
         Text providing descriptive details about  the  connector
         work security map.

     work-security-map-name

         The name of the work security map to be created.
