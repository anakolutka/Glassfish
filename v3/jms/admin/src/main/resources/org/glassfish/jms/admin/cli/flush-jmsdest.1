OPTIONS
     -t --terse                  Indicates that any  output  data
                                 must  be very concise, typically
                                 avoiding   human-friendly   sen-
                                 tences    and   favoring   well-
                                 formatted data  for  consumption
                                 by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo                   Setting to true  will  echo  the
                                 command  line  statement  on the
                                 standard  output.   Default   is
                                 false.

     -I --interactive            If set to true  (default),  only
                                 the  required  password  options
                                 are prompted.

     -H --host                   The  machine  name   where   the
                                 domain  administration server is
                                 running. The  default  value  is
                                 localhost.

     -p --port                   The HTTP/S port for  administra-
                                 tion.  This is the port to which
                                 you should point your browser in
                                 order  to manage the domain. For
                                 example, http://localhost:4848.

                                 The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure                 If set to true, uses SSL/TLS  to
                                 communicate   with   the  domain
                                 administration server.

     -u --user                   The authorized  domain  adminis-
                                 tration   server  administrative
                                 username.

                                 If you have authenticated  to  a
                                 domain  using  the asadmin login
                                 command,  then  you   need   not
                                 specify  the  --user  option  on
                                 subsequent  operations  to  this
                                 particular domain.

     --passwordfile              The --passwordfile option speci-
                                 fies  the  name,  including  the
                                 full path, of a file  containing
                                 the   password   entries   in  a
                                 specific format. The  entry  for
                                 the   password   must  have  the
                                 AS_ADMIN_ prefix followed by the
                                 password   name   in   uppercase
                                 letters.

                                 For  example,  to  specify   the
                                 domain   administration   server
                                 password, use an entry with  the
                                 following                format:
                                 AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,
                                 where  password  is  the  actual
                                 administrator  password.   Other
                                 passwords  that can be specified
                                 include AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                                 AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,       and
                                 AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                                 All remote commands must specify
                                 the  admin password to authenti-
                                 cate to the  domain  administra-
                                 tion  server,  either through --
                                 passwordfile or  asadmin  login,
                                 or  interactively on the command
                                 prompt. The asadmin  login  com-
                                 mand can be used only to specify
                                 the admin  password.  For  other
                                 passwords,  that  must be speci-
                                 fied for  remote  commands,  use
                                 the --passwordfile or enter them
                                 at the command prompt.

                                 If you have authenticated  to  a
                                 domain  using  the asadmin login
                                 command,  then  you   need   not
                                 specify   the   admin   password
                                 through    the    --passwordfile
                                 option  on subsequent operations
                                 to this particular domain.  How-
                                 ever, this is applicable only to
                                 AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.   You
                                 will  still  need to provide the
                                 other  passwords,  for  example,
                                 AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,   as  and
                                 when required by individual com-
                                 mands, such as update-file-user.

                                 For security reasons,  passwords
                                 specified   as   an  environment
                                 variable will  not  be  read  by
                                 asadmin.

                                 The    default     value     for
                                 AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD       is
                                 changeit.

     --help                      Displays the help text  for  the
                                 command.

     --target                    This option  helps  specify  the
                                 location  of the JMS destination
                                 from where you want to clean the
                                 messages. Valid values are:

                                          is   the  name  of  the
                                          default server instance
                                          and   is   the  default
                                          value.

                                 This option  is  valid  only  in
                                 domains  that  are configured to
                                 support   clusters,   such    as
                                 domains  that  are  created with
                                 the  cluster  profile   or   the
                                 enterprise profile.

     ---desttype                 This option indicates  the  type
