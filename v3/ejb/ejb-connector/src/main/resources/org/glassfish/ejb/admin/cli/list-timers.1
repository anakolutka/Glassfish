NAME
     list-timers -  lists all  of  the  timers  owned  by  server
     instance(s)

SYNOPSIS
     list-timers
     [--help]
     target

DESCRIPTION
     The list-timers command lists the timers owned by a specific
     server  instance  or a cluster of server instances. Adminis-
     trators can use this information to decide whether to  do  a
     timer  migration or to verify that a migration has been com-
     pleted successfully. This command  is  supported  in  remote
     mode only.

OPTIONS

OPERANDS

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.
