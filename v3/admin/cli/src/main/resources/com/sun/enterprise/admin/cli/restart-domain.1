NAME
     restart-domain -  restarts the DAS of the specified domain

SYNOPSIS
     restart-domain  [--terse={false|true}] [ --echo ={false|true}]
     [ --host  host ] [--port admin-port ]
     [--user admin-user] [--passwordfile file-name]

DESCRIPTION
     Use  the  restart-domain  command  to  restart  the   Domain
     Administration  Server  (DAS)  of  the specified domain. The
     domain is specified through  a  combination  of  the  --host
     option  and  the  --port  option. The domain must already be
     started.

     The restart-domain command does not exit until  the  command
     has verified that the domain has been stopped and restarted.

     A domain might be started with the  verbose  option  of  the
     start-domain(1)  command  set  to  true.  In this situation,
     after the domain  is  restarted,  messages  continue  to  be
     displayed  in  the  console  window that was opened when the
     domain was originally started.

     This command can be run in the remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     -t--terse

         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default
         is false.

     -e --echo
         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         to the standard output. Default is false.

     -H --host

         The machine name where the domain administration  server
         is running. The default value is localhost.

     -p --port
         The HTTP port or HTTPS  port  for  administration.  This

         port is the port in the URL that you specify in your web
         browser   to   manage   the   domain,    for    example,
         http://localhost:4848.

         The default port number for administration is 4848.

     -u --user

         The user name of the authorized administrative  user  of
         the domain administration server.

         If you have authenticated to a domain by using the asad-
         min  login  command,  you  need  not  specify the --user
         option for subsequent operations on the domain.

     --passwordfile
         Specifies the name, including the full path, of  a  file
         that contains the password entries in a specific format.

         The password is defined in the following form:

           AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password

         password is the actual administrator  password  for  the
         domain.

OPERANDS
     None.
