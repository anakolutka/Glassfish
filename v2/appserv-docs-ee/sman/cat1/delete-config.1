DESCRIPTION
     Use the delete-config command to delete an  existing  confi-
     guration in the domain.xml file. You can delete a configura-
     tion only if the configuration has no  server  instances  or
     clusters  referring  to  it.   A standalone configuration is
     automatically deleted when the  sever  instance  or  cluster
     referring  to  it is deleted. You cannot delete the default-
     config configuration that is used to create  new  standalone
     configurations.

OPTIONS
     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

     -w --password           The --password option is deprecated.
                             Use --passwordfile instead.

     --passwordfile          This option replaces the  --password
                             option.  Using the --password option
                             on the command line or  through  the
                             environment  is  deprecated.  The --
                             passwordfile  option  specifies  the
                             name of a file  containing the pass-
                             word entries in a specified  format.
                             The  entry  for  the  password  must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name  in  capital
                             letters.  For  example,  to  specify
                             the   domain  administration  server
                             password, use  an  entry   with  the
                             following                    format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password. Other passwords  that  can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_MQPASSWORD, and so on.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain

                             administration requests. The default
                             port  number  for Enterprise Edition
                             is 4849.

                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-

                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.
