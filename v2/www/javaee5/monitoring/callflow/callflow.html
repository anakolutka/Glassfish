Welcome to the Callflow Monitoring home page. This page is dedicated to
discussing the monitoring feature called CallFlow in GlassFish. The
source code is part of the cvs repository.
<h3>CallFlow News</h3>
<p>GlassFish now enables a application developer/server administrator
monitor the behaviour of applications deployed in the appserver. A
developer can use this feature at development time to see how the
application behaves in the server. An administrator can use this
feature to see the behaviour of applications in the server.</p>

<h3>Feature</h3>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor applications deployed on GlassFish. Collects runtime
information about an application, like the user principal, transaction
id, application name, method name, exceptions, time spent in various
containers. Call is monitored as it flows through various containers in
the appserver and through the user application code. For e.g: Consider
a web app calling a ejb method foo. In this particular scenario,
callflow will monitor information about a request as it came into the
web container, it will monitor it information as it goes to web app
service method, monitor the call going to the ejb container and finally
to the ejb method foo. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turned On and Turned Off explicitly via admin cli and admin gui.
Turning on callflow, starts collecting data during runtime. This data
is written to a database to be queried later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Query/Data Mining : Post collection of information, callflow is
turned off and the data collected is mined to show user information
about requests hitting the application. A user can look at a particular
request to drill down to get more information like the callstack and
time spent in various containers as well as the application code.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Callflow is turned on via admin gui and admin cli. On turning on the
server starts collecting monitoring information for the applications
deployed in the appserver. Callflow is then turned off and admin gui is
used to query the data collected.</p>
<p>Callflow data collection collects information like: transaction id,
user principal, time in various containers, method name, application
name, module name, exception etc. This information is persisted into a
database.</p>
<p>Callflow query/data mining aspect, looks at this information and
constructs the flow of a particular request through various containers
in the appserver. It presents a call stack of this information. A user
can look at this stack and graphically see the flow of the call and
information like exceptions raised in application code etc. For each
request a user can also view the times taken in various containers as
well as the application code. A user can filter calls based on ip
address and user principal.</p>
<p>An agent called the &#8220;<a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/appserv-commons/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/admin/monitor/callflow">CallFlow
Agent</a>&#8221; sits inside the core appserver container. This agent serves
as the input point where all the callflow data is collected. Containers
like EJB container, Web Container, IIOP Layer and Inbound connector
calls make a call to the CallFlow agent to push information into the
CallFlow layer.</p>

<p>The callflow implementation sits under the <a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/monitor">admin/monitor</a>
package. Database access is abstracted via a <a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/monitor/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/admin/monitor/callflow/DbAccessObject.java">DbAccessObject</a>
class. Furthermore DbAccessObject hands all table accessing to the
individual <a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/monitor/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/admin/monitor/callflow/AbstractTableAccessObject.java">TableAccessObject</a>s.
Agent is the conduit between the admin-gui/admin-cli (i.e the front end
&#8211; the datamining part) and the backend (i.e. The database access part).
It also forms the conduit between the appserver containers (i.e. The
data collection end) and the backend. <a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/monitor/src/java/com/sun/enterprise/admin/monitor/callflow/AsyncHandler.java">AsyncHandler</a>
is a high performance async writer that collects data coming in from
the various containers and writes them out asynchronously to the
Database layer. The db layer itself performs batch updates to the
database. The idea here is to write out the records as quickly and
efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>Per commit procedures the Quicklook tests are required for all
areas. In addition to the quicklook tests, we have two more sets of
tests that we run. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/monitor/tests">Admin/monitor</a>
tests. These junit tests currently test the database access layer and
individual TableAccessObjects. They test both the collection and query
aspects of the database. There are about <b><font color="#800000">30</font></b>
tests in all and all should pass. To run the tests to connect to a
standalone database, start derby database that comes along with the
appserver (go to the quicklook directory and run ant startDerby) and
then do maven compile-tests and maven run-tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://fisheye.cenqua.com/java.net/viewrep/glassfish/admin/mbeanapi-impl">Admin/mbeanapi-impl</a>
tests: These are AMX tests that test the entire featureset from the
front end to the backend. You can do the following to just run the
CallFlow specific tests. Copy amxtest.classes to myamxtest.classes.
Remove all the lines from myamxtest.classes except
com.sun.enterprise.management.monitor.CallFlowMonitorTest. Open
amxtest.properties and modify the following properties
amxtest.connect.useTLS=false , amxtest.testClasses=myamxtest.classes
and amxtest.iterations=1. Do a maven run-tests. All the tests should
pass here.</p>
  </li>

the tests.&nbsp; For an example see the <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/webtier/webtierhome.html">webtier

<h3><a name="Callflow_Vs_Profiler"></a>Callflow Vs Profiler</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Callflow monitoring operates non-intrusively; that is, the
runtime overhead is negligible. Whereas a profiler typically intrudes
into and changes the timing characteristics of application threads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Callflow monitoring implementation has an intimate relationship
with the container, and so it is able to collect information such as
application name, module name, component name, component type,
transaction id, security principal, et cetera. Such information is not
readily available to a profiler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Callflow monitoring implementation collects the call flow data
and stores them in a database. In a future release, this raw data may
be accessed by third-party data mining tools, in order to slice and
dice the data in infinite ways to project useful information in the
form of graphs, pick up trends, et cetera.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Callflow monitoring provides the ability to monitor calls that
originate specifically from a remote client and a user id. This allows
selective monitoring of requests, without unnecessarily intruding into
other parts of the runtime system. This is very useful while running
large scale application services such as internet sites that support
thousands of concurrent client.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="ToDo_List"></a>ToDo List</h3>
GlassFish is currently in beta (as of Feb 2006). Going ahead in the
next couple of months major emphasis will be on bug fixes and improving
the quality of this component.<br>
<br>
In the order of preference. <br>
<ol>
  <li>Bug fixes. The bugs for callflow are under the monitoring area.</li>
  <li>Add end to end tests under the quicklook tests</li>
  <li>Add junit tests under admin/monitor to test Callflow Agent and
AsyncHandler explicitly.</li>
  <li>Add stress tests to stress out the db layer.</li>
  <li>Improve performance.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Future Directions:</h3>
1. Replace the DB layer to use ejb 3 persistence or standalone
persistence features in glassfish. (Callflow was implemented before the
ejb3 persistence api's were implemented.)<br>
2. Provide more powerful data mining queries.<br>
3. Provide queries that return paginated responses. Currently admin gui
holds the responsibility of paginating responses from the database.<br>
4. Allow for admin gui to export callflow data to text files, such that
they can be analyzed offline.<br>
5. Allow admin gui to go to a specific response from a separate input
button,instead of having to scroll down.<br>
