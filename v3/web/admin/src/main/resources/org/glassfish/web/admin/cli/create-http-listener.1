DESCRIPTION
     The create-http-listener command creates an  HTTP  listener.
     This command is supported in remote mode only.

     Note -

       If  you  edit  the  special  HTTP  listener  named  admin-
       listener,  you  must restart the server for the changes to
       take effect. The Administration Console does not tell  you
       that a restart is required in this case.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --listeneraddress

         The IP address or the hostname (resolvable by DNS).

     --listenerport

         The port number to create the listen  socket  on.  Legal
         values  are  1-65535.  On  UNIX,  creating  sockets that
         listen on ports 1-1024  requires  superuser  privileges.
         Configuring  an  SSL listen socket to listen on port 443
         is recommended.

     --default-virtual-server or --defaultvs

         The ID attribute of the default virtual server for  this
         listener.  --defaultvs is kept for compatibility.

     --servername

         Tells the server what to put in the host name section of
         any  URLs  it sends to the client. This affects URLs the
         server automatically generates; it  doesn't  affect  the

         URLs  for  directories  and  files stored in the server.
         This name should be the alias name if your  server  uses
         an  alias. If a colon and port number are appended, that
         port will be used in URLs that the server sends  to  the
         client.

     --acceptorthreads

         The number of acceptor threads for the listener  socket.
         The recommended value is the number of processors in the
         machine. The default value is 1.

     --xpowered

         If set to true, adds the X-Powered-By:  Servlet/2.4  and
         X-Powered-By:   JSP/2.0   headers   to  the  appropriate
         responses. The Servlet 2.4 specification defines the  X-
         Powered-By: Servlet/2.4 header, which containers may add
         to servlet-generated responses. Similarly, the  JSP  2.0
         specification  defines the X-Powered-By: JSP/2.0 header,
         which containers may add to responses that use JSP tech-
         nology.   The goal of these headers is to aid in gather-
         ing statistical data  about the use of Servlet  and  JSP
         technology.

     --redirectport

         This option is valid only in domains that are configured
         to  support  clusters,  such as domains that are created
         with the cluster profile or the enterprise profile. Port
         number for redirects. If the HTTP listener is supporting
         non-SSL requests, and a request is received for which  a
         matching security-constraint requires SSL transport, the
         Application  Server  will  automatically  redirect   the
         request to this port number.

     --securityenabled

         If set to true, the HTTP listener runs SSL. You can turn
         SSL2 or SSL3 ON or OFF and set ciphers using an SSL ele-
         ment. The security setting globally enables or  disables
         SSL  by  making  certificates  available  to  the server
         instance. The default value is false.

     --enabled

         If set to true, the listener is enabled at runtime.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     listener_id                 The  listener  ID  of  the  HTTP
                                 listener.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Using the create-http-listener command

     The following command creates an HTTP  listener  named  sam-
     pleListener  that  uses  a  nondefault  number  of  acceptor
     threads and is not enabled at runtime:

       asadmin> create-http-listener --user admin1
       --passwordfile passwords.txt --host host1 --port 4848
       --listeneraddress 0.0.0.0 --listenerport 7272
       --default-virtual-server server --servername host1.sun.com
       --acceptorthreads 100 --securityenabled=false
       --enabled=false sampleListener
       Command create-http-listener executed successfully.

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
