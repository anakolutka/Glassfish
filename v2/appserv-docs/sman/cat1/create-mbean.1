DESCRIPTION
     Creates and registers a custom MBean. If the  target  MBean-
     Server is not running, the MBean is not registered.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     If an option has a short option name, then the short  option
     precedes  the  long option name. Short options have one dash
     whereas long options have two dashes.

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must
                             be  very concise, typically avoiding
                             human-friendly sentences and  favor-
                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on the standard
                             output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive        If set to true (default),  only  the
                             required    password   options   are
                             prompted.

     -H --host               The machine name  where  the  domain
                             administration  server  is  running.
                             The default value is localhost.

     -p --port               The HTTP/S port for  administration.
                             This is the port to which you should
                             point  your  browser  in  order   to
                             manage  the  domain.   For  example,

                             http://localhost:4848.

                             The default port number is 4848.

     -s --secure             If set to true, uses SSL/TLS to com-
                             municate with the domain administra-
                             tion server.

     -u --user               The authorized domain administration
                             server administrative username.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             --user  option  on subsequent opera-
                             tions to this particular domain.

     --passwordfile          The --passwordfile option  specifies
                             the  name  of  a file containing the
                             password entries in a specific  for-
                             mat. The entry for the password must
                             have the AS_ADMIN_  prefix  followed
                             by  the  password  name in uppercase
                             letters.

                             For example, to specify  the  domain
                             administration  server password, use
                             an entry with the following  format:
                             AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password,    where
                             password is the actual administrator
                             password.  Other  passwords that can
                             be         specified         include
                             AS_ADMIN_MAPPEDPASSWORD,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD,           and
                             AS_ADMIN_ALIASPASSWORD.

                             All remote commands must specify the
                             admin  password  to  authenticate to
                             the  domain  administration  server,
                             either   through  --passwordfile  or
                             asadmin login, or  interactively  on
                             the   command  prompt.  The  asadmin
                             login command can be  used  only  to
                             specify   the  admin  password.  For
                             other passwords, that must be speci-
                             fied  for  remote  commands, use the

                             --passwordfile or enter them at  the
                             command prompt.

                             If  you  have  authenticated  to   a
                             domain  using the asadmin login com-
                             mand, then you need not specify  the
                             admin   password   through   the  --
                             passwordfile  option  on  subsequent
                             operations    to   this   particular
                             domain. However, this is  applicable
                             only  to  AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD  option.
                             You will still need to  provide  the
                             other    passwords,   for   example,
                             AS_ADMIN_USERPASSWORD, as  and  when
                             required   by  individual  commands,
                             such as update-file-user.

                             For  security   reasons,   passwords
                             specified as an environment variable
                             will not be read by asadmin.

                             The      default      value      for
                             AS_ADMIN_MASTERPASSWORD is changeit.

     --help                  Displays the help text for the  com-
                             mand.

     --name                  Specifies  the  name  of  the  MBean
                             definition.  It should be unique for
                             a given domain as the namespace  for
                             MBeans  is shared with that for Java
                             EE applications and modules.  There-
                             fore, you should not use the name of
                             a  deployed  enterprise  application
                             for  creating  an MBean. The default
                             name is the  MBean's  implementation
                             class name.

     --objectname            Specifies                        the
                             javax.management.ObjectName  of  the
                             MBean. The ObjectName must be unique
                             within  the  target specified, as is
                             the case with the name of the MBean.
                             The  uniqueness  is required because
                             at runtime the MBeans are registered
                             with their ObjectName and not names.

                             The default  ObjectName  is  of  the
                             format:    user:type=implementation-
                             class-name,name=implementation-
                             class-name.  The user is the name of
                             the JMX Domain  where  these  MBeans
                             will  be  registered.  No  other JMX
                             domain name is allowed.

                             This is the ObjectName that will  be
                             stored  in  the  Application  Server
                             domain's configuration.  At  runtime
                             though, when the MBean is registered
                             in the MBeanServer,  an  identifying
                             property,
                             server=name_of_the_target_server_instance
                             is inserted in the ObjectName.

                             This property is not  persisted.  It
                             is a runtime artifact only.

     --target                Specify the ID of the  server  where
                             the   MBean   will   be  registered.
                             Defaults to the name of  the  Domain
                             Administration Server (DAS).

     --attributes             Specifies the names and  values  of
                             the  attributes  for the initializa-
                             tion of the MBean.

                             Specifies the names  and  values  of
                             the attributes that the MBean should
                             be initialized with. The  attributes
                             are   specified   in   the   format,
                             name1=value1:name2=value2:...    The
                             types  of  these  attributes must be
                             simple Java Types. such as primitive
                             data   types   and   their   wrapper
                             classes.  In general,  an  attribute
                             of  the MBean that could be initial-
                             ized this way  should  have  a  con-
                             structor      that     accepts     a
                             java.lang.String. The data  type  of
                             the  attributes  is  found  from the
                             MBeanInfo of the  MBean.  Once  ini-
                             tialized,   these   attributes   are
                             available  for  modification  later.
                             These  attributes loosely define the
                             metadata of the MBean.

OPERANDS
     implementation-class-namSpecifies fully  qualified  name  of
                             the      MBean's      implementation
                             classname. The class should  have  a
                             default  constructor.  In  case of a
                             Standard MBean,  it  should  be  the
                             name  of  the  class that implements
                             the Standard  MBean  interface.  The
                             classes  and  interfaces  that  this
                             MBean depends upon should be  avail-
                             able to the server. If they are part
                             of the server's classpath, they will
                             be loaded by the server.

                             If a new MBean needs to  be  created
                             while   the   domain  administration
                             server  is  running,  copy  all  the
                             required          classes         to
                             appserver_install_dir/domains_dir/applications/mbeans
                             with  the  proper package structure.
                             The classes will then be dynamically
                             loaded. It is important to note that
                             the MBean  classes  will  be  loaded
                             only  from this location if they are
                             not   loaded   from   the   server's
                             classpath.

                             Once the MBean is  created  success-
                             fully,  when  the  target  server is
                             running,  the  MBean  definition  is
                             persisted in the server's configura-
                             tion and an instance of the MBean is
                             registered in the MBeanServer avail-
                             able in the server's  runtime.  Such
                             an MBean can then be browsed using a
                             standard JMX Console like JConsole.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Using create-mbean example 1

     create-mbean --user admin --passwordfile filename.txt com.sun.example.Foo

     This example creates an MBean definition and registers it in
     the runtime of the domain administration server. The name of
     the MBean is com.example.Foo, the ObjectName of the MBean is
     user:type=com.example.Foo,name=com.sun.example.Foo,server=server.
     The attributes of the MBean will assume the values  dictated
     by the default constructor.

     Example 2: Using create-mbean example 2

     create-mbean --user admin --passwordfile filename.txt --objectname
     "user:type=file,name=students.log" --name file1 --target --attributes
     Location=Root:Level=01 cluster1 com.example.Bar

     This example assumes that there is a target with name  clus-
     ter1, comprised of server instances server1, server2). Clus-
     ters are available only in Enterprise Edition of Application
     Server.

     It creates an MBean definition with name  file1,  ObjectName
     user:type=file,name=students.log (in the configuration). The
     runtime MBean is registered in the  default  MBeanServer  in
     both  server1 and server2. The ObjectNames of the registered
     MBeans                       would                        be
     user:type=file,name=students.log,server=server1          and
     user:type=file,name=students.log,server=server2      respec-
     tively. The attributes named Location and Level in the MBean
     would be initialized to Root and 01 respectively. The  data-
     type of the attributes is derived from MBeanInfo. The MBeans
     will be available during runtime only if server1 and server2
     are running.
