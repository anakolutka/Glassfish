<a name="geqtr"></a><h3>Node Agents</h3><p>A lightweight agent (e.g. hosting a JMX runtime only) is required on each
node in the domain to facilitate remote lifecycle management of instances. Its primary
purpose is to start, stop, and create server instances as instructed by the
DAS. The Node Agent also acts as a watchdog and restarts failed processes.
Like the DAS, the Node Agent should only be required for certain administrative operations
and should not be expected to be highly available. However, the Node Agent
is an &ldquo;always on&rdquo; component, and must be configured to be started by
the native O/S node bootstrap (e.g. Solaris/Linux inetd, or as a Windows service).
A Node Agent is not required for the DAS.</p>
