NAME
     start-domain - starts a domain

SYNOPSIS
     start-domain  [--domaindir domain-dir]
     --user admin_user --passwordfile file_name
     [--terse={true|false}] [ --echo ={true|false}]
     [ --interactive ={true|false}] [ --verbose ={true|false}]
     [ --debug ={true|false}] [domain_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Use the start-domain command  to  start  a  domain.  If  the
     domain directory is not specified, the domain in the default
     as-install/domains directory is started. If there are two or
     more domains, the domain_name operand must be specified.

     On the Mac OS X platform, processes can  bind  to  the  same
     port.  To  avoid this problem, do not start multiple domains
     with the same port number at the same time.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

OPTIONS
     --domaindir

         The directory where the domain  is  to  be  started.  If
         specified,  the  path must be accessible in the filesys-
         tem.  If  not  specified,  the  domain  in  the  default
         install_dir/domains directory is started.

     -u --user
         The authorized domain application server  administrative
         username.

     --passwordfile

         The file containing the domain application server  pass-
         word  associated  with  the administrative instance. The
         password   is   defined   in   the    following    form:
         AS_ADMIN_PASSWORD=password. Where password is the actual
         administrator password for the domain.

     -t--terse
         Indicates that any output data  must  be  very  concise,
         typically avoiding human-friendly sentences and favoring
         well-formatted data for consumption by a script. Default

         is false.

     -e --echo

         Setting to true will echo the command line statement  on
         to the standard output. Default is false.

     -I --interactive
         If set to true (default),  only  the  required  password
         options are prompted.

     --verbose

         Specifies whether detailed server startup  messages  are
         displayed. Possible values are as follows:

         false
             Detailed server startup messages are not displayed.

         true

             A console window is opened in which detailed  server
             startup  messages  are  displayed.  If the domain is
             later restarted by using the restart-domain(1)  com-
             mand, messages continue to be displayed in this con-
             sole window.

             The console window that is opened alsoTMenables  you
             to  obtain  a thread dump and, on UNIX   systems, to
             kill the server:

                 o    On Windows  systems,  press  CTRL-Break  to
                      obtain a thread dump.

                 o    On UNIX systems, press CTRL-C to  kill  the
                      server  and press CTRL-\ to obtain a thread
                      dump.

     --debug
         By default this flag is set to false. If  set  to  true,
         the  server is started in debug mode and prints the JPDA
         port on the console.
