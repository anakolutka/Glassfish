        This xml file contains descriptions of name-lists referenced from domain.rng element's 
     "forms-from" elements of these descriptions define collection of xpathes generating each list
        Strictly speaking, we can receive such list by XSLTing domain.rng, but I had no time to 
     implement the transformation schemas. Besides, the "forms-from"es are really inllustrative 
     and they are easy to maintain.
     Name lists are using for validation of names uniqueness and mutual elements' referencing.
     More precise term for "name-list" would be name-domain", but it was rejected to avoid confusions 
     with "domain".
