/**
 * Init services are run at server start. They are run after the component manager
 * is initialized but before the Startup services are run. Startup are meant to be
 * public API where users can add their own start up services. This is not the case
 * for Init services which results are expected to be fully constructed at the time
 * the first startup service is ran.
 *
 * One of the thing that an Init service can do is initialize the security manager
 * or logging or even add modules and repositories to GlassFish where Startup services
 * can be loaded from.
