  <!-- #BeginEditable "intro" --> 
  <p>The Administrative Infrastructure of Glassfish Application Server revolves 
    around JMX. A key component of JMX is being able to remotely connect to the 
    MBeanServer. <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=160">JSR 160</a> (which 
    is now<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=255"> JSR 255</a>) is an extension 
    of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=003">JSR 003</a> that dealt with 
    this problem alone. Because of the far reaching impact of this development 
    in <i>management of Java</i>, JMX and JSR 160 were <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/index.html">incorporated 
    into Java 5 SE</a>.</p>
  <p>Introduction of JMX in Java 5 SE however, mandated that the remote management 
    of a JMX-instrumented VM be done over RMI/JRMP as a standard. Though RMI is 
    a well known protocol, unfortunately it is not accepted as an industry standard 
    if HTTP can be utilized. Application Server's administration has been done 
    over HTTP and HTTP/S and that was the basic reason why we had to come up with 
    a proprietary implementation of JSR 160 over HTTP/S.</p>

  <p><!-- #BeginEditable "technology" -->The basic reason why we had to do a Glassfish-proprietary 
    implementation of JSR 160 specification over HTTP is twofold: 
    <ul>
      <li>Reuse the administration port that is known to a human administrator. 
        It is important that the administrator has to remember one single port 
        for administration independent of the tool he uses to manage. The tool 
        can be a command line interface, HTML Graphical user interface (GUI) or 
        an IDE. If we had used the RMI/JRMP connector server, it would have needed 
        its own port, whereas the HTML pages that GUI needs are served by the 
        web-container. </li>
      <li>HTTP allows remote administration of an appserver domain from other 
        machines (especially outside the secure firewall) more seamlessly (than 
        RMI, for HTTP tunneling of RMI would be needed).</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- #EndEditable --><br>
  </p>
  <!-- #BeginEditable "technology2" --> 
  <p>It is interesting to see how Glassfish resolves the need for multiple ports 
    of administration. At its core, the server side implementation alleviates 
    the need for a TCP Server Socket by the virtue of a servlet that is running 
    on the web-container port. Since we know that multiple web applications can 
    be served by the web-container simultaneously, a special web application can 
    act as a server side implementation of JSR 160. The following structure emerges:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A servlet reads its standard input stream (decorated to be an ObjectInputStream) 
      for Serialized Java Objects.</li>
    <li>The client side implementation is retrofitted into the JSR 160 standard 
      to use proprietary protocols named &quot;<i>s1ashttp</i>&quot; and &quot;<i>s1ashttps</i>&quot; 
      to denote and search the appropriate handlers.</li>
    <li>The client side then opens HttpURLConnection and HttpsURLConnection to 
      write to servlet's input stream.</li>
    <li>The connection is authenticated using HTTP Basic-Auth.</li>
    <li>Servlet deserializes the Objects it receives on its InputStream, invokes 
      the MBeanServer associated and returns the results in exactly the same manner 
      that it read. The client side reads the response, deserializes it and returns 
      the values or throws the exceptions that were thrown by MBeanServer invocation.</li>
  </ul>
