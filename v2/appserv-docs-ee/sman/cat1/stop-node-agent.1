DESCRIPTION
     The local stop-node-agent command is used  to  stop  a  node

     agent in the  default  install_dir/nodeagents  directory  is

     server instances of the node agent.

     This command is supported in local mode only.

      --agentdir             Like a Domain Administration  Server
                             (DAS),  each node agent resides in a
                             top    level     directory     named
                             agentdir/nodeagent_name.  If  speci-
                             fied, the path must be accessible in
                             the  filesystem.  If  not specified,
                             defaults           to            the

     -t --terse              Indicates that any output data  must

                             ing well-formatted data for consump-
                             tion by a script. Default is false.

     -e --echo               Setting to true will echo  the  com-
                             mand  line statement on to the stan-
                             dard output. Default is false.

                             required options are prompted.
