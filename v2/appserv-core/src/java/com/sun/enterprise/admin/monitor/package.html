  <H4>Overview</H4>
  <P>
  iAS 7.0 SE monitoring framework is built on top of infrastructure provided by
  <A href="http://java.sun.com/products/JavaManagement/index.html">JMX</A> (Java
  Management Extenstions). A set of MBeans dedicated to monitoring are
  registered to the MBeanServer running in every instance. These MBeans are
  queried from the administration server whenever a user requests statistics.</P>

  <P>The communication between admin server and adminitered instance is done over
  the admin channel. For more details, please see the admin channel
  <A HREF="../server/core/channel/package-summary.html">package description</A>.
  Admin channel is used to send notifications from admin server to the instance.
  For monitoring, the notification <A HREF="../event/MonitoringEvent.html">MonitoringEvent</A>
  is used. The notification supports four actions - start monitoring, stop
  monitoring, get monitoring data and list monitorable components.</P>

  <P>A set of MBeans dedicated to monitoring task are created and registered
  to MBean server by the components that need to be monitored. These MBeans
  are organized in a tree structure with a pre defined root. Monitoring
  MBeans are identified by a type, name and a parent. The tree can be
  extended in any direction as long as a MBean does not conflict with any
  other MBean under its parent.</P>

  <H4>MonitoredObectType</H4>

  <P>An instance of this class rpresents the type of monitoring MBean. This
  class defines various <code>public static</code> constants representing
  known monitoring MBean types.</P>

  <P>A type can be designated as singleton, which will enforce that only one
  MBean of that type exists under a given node of Monitoring MBean tree. For
  example, ejb pool is a singleton, because for every stateless session bean
  there is one pool.</P>

  <FONT size="-1"><A HREF="MonitoredObjectType.html">Description</A></FONT>

  <H4>BaseMonitorMBean</H4>

  <P>This is the abstract super class of all monitoring MBeans. It implements
  the JMX interface DynamicMBean and also provides start and stop methods to
  manage monitoring state. All the basic tree management features are also
  available through this object.</P>

  <FONT size="-1"><A HREF="BaseMonitorMBean.html">Description</A></FONT>

  <H4>GenericMonitorMBean</H4>

  <P>This is a simple concrete sub-class of BaseMonitorMBean that exposes
  no monitorable statistics but can be used to group other monitoring
  MBeans by building up the tree of Monitoring MBeans. The only significant
  implementation in this class is those of methods startMonitoring and
  stopMonitoring call the same method on all its children,</P>

  <FONT size="-1"><A HREF="GenericMonitorMBean.html">Description</A></FONT>

  <H4>MonitoringHelper</H4>

  <P>A helper (utility) class to manage monitoring MBeans. This class
  uses GenericMonitorMBean to build up the tree, whenever a node does not
  exist in the tree.</P>

  <FONT size="-1"><A HREF="MonitoringHelper.html">Description</A></FONT>

  <H4>MBean Naming</H4>

  <P>The object name for monitoring MBeans is based on the position of the
  MBean in the tree. The name and type of MBean is represented by the property
  called <code>name</code> and <code>mclass</code> respectively. In addition
  to that, all object names contain properties describing its parent node.</P>

  <P>The root MBean for monitoring is named
  <code>ias:type=monitor,mclass=root,name=root,instance-name=ias1</code>. All
  MBeans in iAS 7.0 SE have the same domain <code>ias</code>. The property
  <code>type</code> is required by MBeanServer and should always be set to
  <code>monitor</code>. The property <code>instance-name</code> is also required
  by the MBeanServer implementation and must be set to the name of the server
  instance. As there is only one root monitoring MBean, its name is always
  <code>root</code>. The value for mclass is derived from MonitoredObjectType.</P>

  <P>If there is a MBean registered to monitor an application called app1, to
  its parent, the root monitoring MBean, the name will be
  <code>ias:type=monitor,mclass=application,name=app1,root=root,instance-name=ias1</code>.
  In addition to the required properties -- <code>type</code>, <code>instance-name</code>,
  <code>mclass</code> and <CODE>name</CODE>, the object name contains a reference
  to the parent MBean by applying a transform to the properties <code>mclass</code>
  and <code>name</CODE> of the parent -- the transform is to convert the value
  of <code>mclass</code> attribute to a property name and the value of the
  <code>name</code> attribute to the value of that property. A general rule is
  that a child MBean name contains all properties other than <code>mclass</code>
  and <CODE>name</CODE> with same values as in its parent.</P>

  <P>More examples, a monitoring MBean for ejb module mod1 in application app1
  will be named <code>ias:type=monitor,mclass=ejb-module,name=mod1,application=app1,root=root,instance-name=ias1</code>.
  A monitoring MBean for stateless session bean bean1 in module mod1 and
  application app1 will be named <code>ias:type=monitor,mclass=stateless-bean,name=bean1,ejb-module=mod1,application=app1,root=root,instance-name=ias1</code>.
  </P>

  <H4>CLI Name Mapping</H4>

  <P>CLI names address MBeans under root monitoring MBean in any instance.
  The CLI names are of the form -- </P>
  <PRE>
      instanceName([.type[.name])*[.(star|attrName)]
  where,
     instanceName is name of server instance,
     type is derived from MonitoredObjectType,
     name is monitored component name,
     star is the character * (denotes all attributes)
     attrName is the name of the attribute
  </PRE>

  <P>The other rules for CLI names are --</P>
  <OL>
  <LI>(star|attrName) is required only for GET command. It should not be
  present for other commands.</LI>
  <LI>For a singleton MonitoredObjectType, name must not be specified. For
  non-singleton types both name and type must be specified.</LI>
  </OL>
  <P>For example, CLI name <code>ias1.application.myApp.module.fortune_jar.stateless-bean.fortune.pool</code>
  addresses the MBean monitoring pool for stateless session bean named fortune
  contained within the module fortune_jar in the J2EE application myApp.</P>

  <H4>Monitorable Attribute Type</H4>

  <P>There is a package com.sun.enterprise.admin.monitor.types that defines
  types for monitorable attributes (See <A href="types/package-summary.html">
  Description</A>). JMX supports three different types of Monitorable attributes
  -- Counter, Gauge and String and there are classes corresponding to them
  in this package.</P>

  <P>JMX model for monitoring suggests one MBean for every monitorable
  attribute. The JMX monitoring MBean acts as an observer of the statistic
  exposed by some other MBean and collects statistic at pre defined interval.
  It also manages notification for thresold values. For iAS 7.0 SE, a simpler
  approach has been taken and an attempt has been made to collect as much data
  as possible, so that transition to full JMX model will be easier.</P>

  <P>Another expectation for iAS 7.0 SE is that all monitorable attribute
  values have a simple <code>toString()</code> representation that is used to
  display statistic on the user interface.</P>

  <H4>Tutorial</H4>

  <H5><B>Step 1:</B> Create a Monitoring MBean</H5>
  <P>The first step is to determine the statistics that need to be exposed,
  their names and types (as defined in the package
  <A href="types/package-summary.html">com.sun.enterprise.admin.monitor.types</A>.
  A naming convention guide for monitorable attributes is maintained by user
  experience group which should be consulted while choosing names. The
  attributes should be exposed through MBeanInfo interface in a sub-class of
  BaseMonitorMBean and the MBean should then be registered to the tree of
  Monitoring MBeans.</P>

  <H5><B>Step 1a:</B> Define Attributes</H5>
  <P>The goal of this step is to create/reference objects that will allow
  creation of a MBeanInfo object and also provide enough information to
  implement methods <code>getMonitoringMetaData()</code> and
  <code>getMonitoredAttributeValues()</code>. Following is a sample
  implementation suitable for use by other protected methods in
  BaseMonitorMBean -- </P>
  <PRE>
    public class MyMonitorMBean extends BaseMonitorMBean {

        /**
         * A 2-d array initialized to attribute names and their types
         */
        private static Object[][] attrNameTypeArray = {
                {"context-root", StringMonitoredAttributeType.DEFAULT},
                {"count-requests", Counter.INTEGER},
                {"average-response-time-seconds", Counter.INTEGER},
                {"count-servlets-deployed", Counter.INTEGER}
            };
  </PRE>
  <P>As stated earlier, the goal is to provide easy implementation of the
  methods <code>getMBeanInfo()</code>, <code>getMonitoringMetaData()</code>
  and <code>getMonitoredAttributeValues()</code>, so if you have other
  ways of implementing those methods, you do not need to declare a 2-d object
  array of monitorable attribute names and types.</P>
  <H5><B>Step 1b:</B> Create MBeanInfo</H5>
  <P>This step is relevant only if you used 2-d object array in Step 1a.
  Continuing on from previous example --
  <PRE>
        /**
         * Map of attribute names and their types
         */
        private static Map attrNameTypeMap;

        /**
         * Info on this MBean
         */
        private static MBeanInfo mBeanInfo;

        static {
            attrNameTypeMap = createAttrNameTypeMap(attrNameTypeArray);
            mBeanInfo = createMBeanInfo(attrNameTypeMap);
        }
  </PRE>
  <P>The above steps create an instance of <code>MBeanInfo</code> that can
  be returned directly in the implementation for <code>getMBeanInfo()</code>
  --</P>
  <PRE>
        /**
         * Provides the exposed attributes and actions of the monitoring MBean using
         * an MBeanInfo object.
         * @return An instance of MBeanInfo with all attributes and actions exposed
         *         by this monitoring MBean.
         */
        public MBeanInfo getMBeanInfo() {
            return mBeanInfo;
        }
  </PRE>
  <H5><B>Step 1c:</B> Implement getAttribute</H5>
  <P>The method <code>getAttribute()</code> is expected to return the value of
  specified monitored attribute and the code for that will vary greatly among
  various components being monitored. A sample implementation can be --</P>
  <PRE>
        /**
         * Obtains the value of a specific monitored attribute.
         * @param attribute The name of the attribute to be retrieved
         * @return The value of the attribute retrieved.
         * @throws AttributeNotFoundException if attribute name is not valid
         */
        public Object getAttribute(String attribute) {
            Object retval = null;
            if (attribute.equals(name1)) {
                retval = obj1.getAttr1();
            } else if (attribute.equals(name2)) {
                retval = obj2.getAttr2();
            } else {
                throw new AttributeNotFoundException("Invalid attribute!");
            }
            return retval;
        }
  </PRE>
  <P>Another method <code>getAttributes</code> can be used to get values for
  more than one attributes in same call. This method should also be implemented
  in best possible way. At the minimum, the implementation can call getAttribute
  for every attribute that is on its parameter list.</P>
  <H5><B>Step 1d:</B> Implement other abstract methods</H5>
  <P>The remaining abstract methods that must be implemented are
  <code>getMonitoringMetaData()</code> and
  <code>getMonitoredAttributeValues()</code>. A simple implementation that
  works alongwith the code in Step 1a and 1b above is --</P>
  <PRE>
        /**
         * Get a map of monitored attribute names and their types. The keys
         * in the map are names of the attribute and the values are their
         * types. The type value are instances of class
         * com.iplanet.ias.monitor.type.MonitoredAttributeType (or its
         * sub-classes)
         *
         * @return map of names and types of all monitored attributes
         */
        public Map getMonitoringMetaData() {
            return attrNameTypeMap;
        }

        /**
         * Get type of the specified monitored attribute.
         */
        public MonitoredAttributeType getAttributeType(String attrName) {
                MonitoredAttributeType type = null;
            if (attrNameTypeMap != null && attrName != null) {
                type = (MonitoredAttributeType)attrNameTypeMap.get(attrName);
            }
            return type;
        }
  </PRE>
  <H5><B>Step 2:</B> Register MBean</H5>
  <P>The MBean should be created and registered appropriately, for it to
  become usable by the admin server. The class <code><A href="MonitoringHelper.html">MonitoringHelper</A></code>
  provides some ease of use methods to register MBeans. </P>

  <P>The other approach is to get the root monitoring MBean by a call to the method
  <code><a href="../server/core/AdminService.html#getRootMonitorMBean()">getRootMonitorMBean</a></code> in the class
  <code>com.sun.enterprise.admin.server.core.AdminService</code>. The monitoring
  provider can then traverse through to the node of its interest, starting
  from the top node in monitoring MBean tree, and then add itself as child to
  that node using the method <code><a href="BaseMonitorMBean.html">addChild()</a></code>
  from class <code>BaseMonitorMBean</code>.</P>

  <P>Of course, a combination of the two approaches is to use MonitoringHelper
  to register an MBean, keep a reference to it and then use addChild method on
  it to expand the tree further.</P>
