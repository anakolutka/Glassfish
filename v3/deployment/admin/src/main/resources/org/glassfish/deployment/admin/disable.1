asadmin Utility Subcommands                            disable(1)

NAME
     disable - disables the component

SYNOPSIS
     disable
     [--help]
     [ --target  target_name]
     component_name

DESCRIPTION
     The disable command  immediately  disables  the  named  com-
     ponent.  The  component must have been deployed. If the com-
     ponent has not been deployed, an error message is returned.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     component_name              name of the component to be dis-
                                 abled.
