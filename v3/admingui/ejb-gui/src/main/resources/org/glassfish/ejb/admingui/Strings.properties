ejb.NumBeans=Number of beans

## ORB
headings.Orb=ORB
orb.OrbInfo=The Object Request Broker (ORB) is the central component of CORBA. The ORB provides the required infrastructure to identify and locate objects, handle connection management, deliver data, and request communication. Remote clients of enterprise beans (EJB modules) communicate with the Application Server using the ORB.
orb.maxMsgSizeLabel=Max Message Fragment Size:
orb.maxMsgSizeHelp=IIOP 1.2 message body size
orb.totalConnsLabel=Total Connections:
orb.totalConnsHelp=Maximum number of incoming connections for all IIOP listeners
orb.iiopClientLabel=IIOP Client Authentication:
orb.threadPoolIdLabel=Thread Pool ID:
orb.threadPoolIdHelp=ID for the work queue

ejbSettings.optBHelp=The container caches a ready instance between transactions, but the container does not ensure that the instance has exclusive access to the state of the object in persistent storage. In this case, the container must synchronize the instance's state by invoking ejbLoad from persistent storage at the beginning of the next transaction.
ejbSettings.optC=Option C - Do not cache a ready instance between transactions
ejbSettings.optCHelp=The container does not cache a ready instance between transactions, but instead returns the instance to the pool of available instances after a transaction has completed.
ejbSettings.poolSettingsLabel=Pool Settings
ejbSettings.minSizeLabel=Initial and Minimum Pool Size:
ejbSettings.minSizeHelp=Minimum and initial number of connections maintained in the pool
