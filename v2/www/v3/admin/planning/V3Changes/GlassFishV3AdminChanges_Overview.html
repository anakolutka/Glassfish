        <h1><a name="Goals" id="Goals"></a>Goals</h1>
      <h2><a name="HighLevelGoals" id="HighLevelGoals"></a>High-level Goals</h2>
      <p>High level goals for Admin in GlassFish V3 include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Run inside process</strong>&mdash;making it possible to run GlassFish inside another JVM (eg the JVM
          of a NetBeans project). And, ideally, making it possible to run more than one GlassFish instance withing the same
          JVM (a testing and possibly production feature);</li>
        <li><strong>Manage remotely</strong>&mdash;As with the CLI, the GUI should be able to manage any number of GlassFish domains remotely (today,
          the GUI must run in-process with the DAS server instance of the domain it&rsquo;s managing).</li>
        <li><strong>AMX support for HK2 modules</strong>&mdash;AMX support for configuration of GlassFish HK2 modules, along with
          support for related MBeans, such as monitoring.</li>
        <li><strong>On-demand management</strong>&mdash;management infrastructure (eg AMX) should load when needed (but with granularity
          to be determined).</li>
        <li><strong>New features</strong>&mdash;To be determined. However, the author&rsquo;s view is that restructuring the admin code
          base will leave little or no time for major new features. Long deferred, the code base badly needs a refresh to
        allow rapid implementation of new features, and easier maintainance of old ones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="CodeAndDesignChanges" id="CodeAndDesignChanges"></a>Code and design changes</h2>
      <p>Many changes  must be made for the Admin code in GlassFish V3. These changes include the following (and likely more):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making the MBeanServer independent of the Admin code;</li>
        <li>Reimplementation/redesign of the low-level configuration API, the <span class="code">com.sun.appserv</span> MBeans,
          and the AMX configuration MBeans in light of changes to underlying configuration;</li>
        <li>Decomposing the AdminService into one or more GlassFish HK2 modules;</li>
        <li>Ensuring that all  admin code loads as needed &ldquo;lazily&rdquo; (without introducing undue complexity or testing issues);</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the GUI and CLI can operate using 100% public APS (eg AMX);</li>
        <li>Ability to programmatically start GlassFish via AMX (this dovetails with the ability to run within a process
          also);</li>
        <li>Extending the AMX API to support  configuration of GlassFish V3 modules as well as related monitoring and
          runtime MBeans;</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><a name="PlanOfAttack" id="PlanOfAttack"></a>Development plan of attack</h2>
      <p>The contemplated changes have broad impact. Please see also the <a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_Presentation1.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a> on this topic.</p>
      <p>The approach can be separated
        into three phases&mdash;</p>
      <h3>Phase one &mdash; Research and simplify</h3>
      <p>All existing mechanisms must be fully understood. This includes in particular the validator code, how configuration
        is pushed to remote servers, the extent to which the non-public <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans are used by
        admin GUI and CLI, etc.</p>
      <p>Concurrently with the research, code in <span class="code">SunoneInterceptor</span>, <span class="code">AdminService</span> and <span class="code">ConfigInterceptor</span> should
        be minimized, stripping out all defunct and superfluous code, so that the task of converting can be understood (see
        <a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_CodeCommentary.html" target="_blank"><em>Code Commentary</em></a>).</p>
      <p>The low-level config API (&ldquo;injection&rdquo;) approach should be agreed upon, in a final form that addresses its many issues,
      including thread safety, how MBean interact with it, persistence, whether a DTD is used, how valiation works, etc.</p>
      <p>A written plan should be written for how the existing AdminService, AMX and low level config API converge into a
      cooperative whole.</p>
      <h3>Phase two &mdash; Implement</h3>
      <p>The development should be broken into teams. Key tasks include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AMX loader integration with new low-level configuration API concurrent with the removal of <span class="code">category=config</span> MBeans;</li>
        <li>Formalization of all module configuration APIs, with high-quality javadoc and unit test cases;</li>
        <li>Design and implementation of configuration &ldquo;push&rdquo; to remote servers (in the intermediate term, forced restarts
          might be acceptable).</li>
        <li>GUI and CLI structural work to accomodate user-supplied HK2 modules</li>
        <li>AMX extensions to support user-supplied HK2 modules.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Phase three &mdash; Ongoing development</h3>
      <p>This phase brings new features forward, and makes sure all existing functionality is carried forward, especially
        in multi-server and/or clustered environments.</p>
      <h1><a name="TheExistingCodeBase" id="TheExistingCodeBase"></a>The existing code base</h1>
      <h2><a name="TheMBeanServer" id="TheMBeanServer"></a>The MBeanServer</h2>
      <p>The MBeanServer is a system-wide facility which until late in the GlassFish V2 development cycle could only be created
        correctly by the AdminService. A modification was made to &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; the MBeanServer differently so that
        it could be initialized in main() (PEMain), with subsequent internal state changes upon initialization of the AdminService.
        See
        <a href="SunoneInterceptorChanges.html" target="_blank"><em>Initialization of the MBeanServer in Glassfish&mdash;Fixing
        the SunoneInterceptor initialization</em></a> for details, keeping in mind that the changes actually made deviate
        from the proposed ones in significant respects.</p>
      <h3>MBeanServer code</h3>
      <p>As of September 2007, the code relevant to the MBeanServer was:</p>
      <table class="table100 table-hover">
        <tr>
          <th width="39%">File</th>
          <th width="61%">Comments</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="code">com.sun.enterprise.server.PEMain.<br />
              <strong>LoadMBeanServer</strong></span></td>
          <td>Our &ldquo;wrapper&rdquo; around the MBeanServer.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><span class="code">com.sun.enterprise.interceptor.<br />
              <strong>DynamicInterceptor</strong></span></td>
          <td>Initializes the MBeanServer at startup.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">com.sun.enterprise.admin.server.core.<br />
              <strong>AdminService</strong></td>
          <td>Tweaks <span class="code">DynamicInterceptor</span> so that <span class="code">SunoneInterceptor</span> is inserted into the invocation chain (for some methods).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code"> com.sun.enterprise.admin.server.core.jmx.<br />
          <strong>SunoneInterceptor</strong></td>
          <td>The internal wrapper that implements the tracking of config changes and also dynamic loading of certain (apparently
          exactly 1) MBean.<br />
          <br />
          A key implementation detail is the call to <span class="code">adminContext.getMBeanServerInterceptor()</span> in
          its constructor.<br />
          <br />
          Methods like generateEntryContext() need investigation.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="code">com.sun.enterprise.admin.server.core.<br />
            <strong>ConfigInterceptor[Impl]</strong></td>
          <td>There code is used to implement a proxy which is used by the <span class="code">SunoneInterceptor</span>. There seems to be a lot of
          unused/dead code here and it&rsquo;s not even clear whether this class performs a useful function any longer.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
     
      <p>The only thing preventing the change to use the standard MBeanServer is the code within <span class="code">SunoneInterceptor</span>,
        which maintains (indirectly) a list of config changes, a crude sort of transactional operation (see the <a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_CodeCommentary.html#ConfigInterceptor" target="_blank">code
        commentary on <span class="code">ConfigInterceptor</span></a>). It&rsquo;s
        unclear if <span class="code">ConfigInterceptor</span> has significant value, because it is unsafe when multiple
        clients operate (though this might be detected causing a failure), and client GUI and CLI code make <em>repeated</em> changes,
        each of which enters this code freshly each time, thus defeating any semi-atomic semantics.</p>
      <h2><a name="AdminService" id="AdminService"></a>The AdminService</h2>
      <h3><a name="AdminServiceActivitiesAtInitialization" id="AdminServiceActivitiesAtInitialization"></a>AdminService activities at initialization (GlassFish V2)</h3>
      <p>The expression &ldquo;everything but the kitchen sink&rdquo; applies to  <span class="code">com.sun.enterprise.admin.server.core.AdminService</span>,
        a <span class="code">ServerLifecycle</span> which over time has been modified to include a wide variety of initialization
        code on an ad-hoc basis, with little thought given to dependencies or modularization. There also exists code that
        serves no useful purpose.</p>
      <p class="sidebar">The first step in transitioning to GlassFish V3 is to strip out code that no longer serves a useful
        function; this reduces the confusion that arises trying to read &ldquo;kitchen sink&rdquo; code. Examples include the <span class="code">ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_THREAD</span>        code
        in <span class="code">AdminService</span>, the <span class="code">HOT_CONFIG_METHOD_NAME</span> and related code
        (no-op in practice) in <span class="code">SunoneInterceptor</span>, etc.</p>
      <p>Initialization responsibilities as of Sept 2007 include:</p>
      <ul class="ul-small">
        <li >Installing (enabling) the SunoneInterceptor within DynamicInterceptor;</li>
        <li >Enabling AMX logging;</li>
        <li >initializing CallFlow;</li>
        <li >Registering config MBeans;</li>
        <li >Initializing the JKS keystore if they do not exist (&quot;key3.db&quot;, etc) ;</li>
        <li >Registering the JSR 77 <span class="code">J2EEDomain</span>  <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=runtime</span> MBeans.</li>
        <li >Creating the admin temp directory and setting the admin instanced properties such as ADMIN_JAVAROOT, PLUGIN_JAVAROOT.</li>
        <li >Miscellaneous utility methods like <span class="code">getTempDirPath()</span>.</li>
        <li >Starting the AutoDeployer code;</li>
        <li >Initializing Dotted Names;</li>
        <li >Registering TransactionsRecovery even listener and MBean;</li>
        <li >Initializing the LogManager reconfig support, event listener, MBean, etc;</li>
        <li >Registering the System Services MBean;</li>
        <li >Initializing the AMX MBeans;</li>
        <li >Initializing custom MBean loading;</li>
        <li >Creating and registering the DASDiagnosticMBean;</li>
        <li >Registering the JVMMonitoring MBeans;</li>
        <li >Notifying the node agents;</li>
        <li >Publishing the process ID (PID).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each of these items should be examined. A few items might naturally become part of a distinct module. For example,
        the auto-deployment code makes sense as a module, as does AMX itself. An AdminService module makes sense, and it
        might still be responsible for initializing a number of administration-related facilities&mdash;but the code should be
        restructured such that the AdminService is a more general purpose &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; supporting a number of smaller services.</p>
      <h2><a name="TheLowLevelConfigAPI" id="AdminService2"></a>The low-level Config API</h2>
      <p>The so-called &ldquo;Config API&rdquo; is the API used internally, and by the <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans.
        This API is due for replacement with one that can support arbitrary configuration for user-supplied modules. </p>
      <p>By reengineering this low-level API, we might be able to produce a system where the &ldquo;config bean&rdquo; and the AMX MBean
        are one and the same, and also used by HK2 modules. That would greatly simplify the current structure, in which AMX
        calls a <span class="code">com.sun.apperv:category=config</span> MBean, which in turn calls the Config API.</p>
      <p class="sidebar">As of October 2007, the HK2 proposal calls for &ldquo;injection&rdquo; of configuration value-by-value
        into a module&rsquo;s configuration
        object.</p>
      <h2><a name="com_sun_appserv_ConfigMBeans" id="com_sun_appserv_ConfigMBeans"></a>The <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span>        MBeans</h2>
      <p><strong>Elimination of these MBeans should be a priority</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>they take considerable time to initialize</li>
        <li>they
          are not part of any public API</li>
        <li>they are not even used internally to the server (except as delegates for the
          AMX <span class="code">Delegate </span> implementation)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is a natural time to remove them, given that the low-level <a href="#TheLowLevelConfigAPI">Config
          API</a> is due for an overhaul. Unfortunately, some of these MBeans do more the configuration; they perform operations
          as well&mdash;and a few of them are not &ldquo;config&rdquo; at all, but rather operational MBeans that operate on configuration.
          There is a mess here and cleaning it up will take some work.</p>
      <h2><a name="com_sun_appserv_MonitoringAndRuntimeMBeans" id="com_sun_appserv_ConfigMBeans2"></a>The <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=monitor</span>        and runtime MBeans</h2>
      <p>The <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=monitor</span> MBeans should also be eliminated. The AMX monitoring
        MBeans (<span class="code">amx:j2eeTytpe=X-*Monitor</span>) can be <strong>registered directly</strong> by the code
        that generates the monitoring information.</p>
      <p class="sidebar">A generic interface similar to the AMX Delegate interface should be used to decouple the AMX monitoring MBeans from
        implementation. It is particularly important to formalize this contract in the context of user supplied HK2 modules.<br />
      </p>
      <h1><a name="ImpactsOnAdmin" id="ImpactsOnAdmin"></a>Impacts on admin area</h1>
      <p>Considerable impact is felt throughout the admin area due to this change. GlassFish V2 makes use of the &ldquo;Config
        API&rdquo; (XPath-based) upon which is layered the complex <span class="code">com.sun.appserv</span> MBean layer.
        AMX in turn depends on the <span class="code">com.sun.appserv</span> MBeans, using them as Delegates for its config
        MBeans. The admin GUI and CLI depend on all of these MBeans.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_GUI_CLI" id="Impacts_GUI_CLI"></a>Admin GUI and CLI impacts</h2>
      <p>While the admin GUI and CLI uses AMX for 90-95% of their code base, some code might still depend on <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans
        that provide <strong>operations</strong> (not just configuration). There might also exist implicit side effects which
        will &ldquo;go away&rdquo; when the underlying implementation is changed.</p>
      <p class="action"><strong>ACTION</strong>: GUI and CLI teams to assess whether they depend on undocumented/unspecified
        behavior when modifying configuration, deploying applications that also modifies configurations, etc.</p>
      <p>AMX is expected to stay largely compatible, so the bulk of the GUI and CLI code will remain viable. However, both
        the GUI and CLI will need enhancements to support administration of pluggable modules. Modules that include hierarchical
        configuration pose the biggest challenge, particularly for creating and deleting configuration.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_SpecialCaseMBeans" id="Impacts_SpecialCaseMBeans"></a>Special-cased MBeans</h2>
      <p>There exist special case <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans that process certain types
        of configuration that require special handling, such as passwords. This functionality will need to reside somewhere,
        possibly in (revised) AMX MBeans.</p>
      <p class="action"><strong>ACTION</strong>: GUI and CLI teams to survey code for non-AMX usage as well as operations
        invoked on category=config MBeans.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_Validator" id="Impacts_Validator"></a>Validator code</h2>
      <p>The validator code (code that verifies legality of changes to configuration) is currently hooked into the GlassFish
        V2 &ldquo;Config API&rdquo;. In addition, the <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans might
        contain special-case checks for certain configuration changes.</p>
      <p class="action"><strong>ACTION</strong>: understand at what level the validation code hooks into the GlassFish V2
        Config API, and how it would hook into the new configuration paradigm.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_AMXDependencies" id="Impacts_AMXDependencies"></a>AMX Dependencies</h2>
      <p> For configuration support, <a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/javaee5/amx/index.html" target="_blank">AMX</a> depends
        on <span class="code">com.sun.appserv:category=config</span> MBeans via its <span class="code">Delegate</span> interface,
        an effective means of decoupling itself from underlying implementation.</p>
      <p>AMX even contains an undocumented feature whereby it can replace its usual <span class="code">Delegate</span> with
        on that uses the GlassFish V2 Config API directly, all <em>without change to the AMX MBeans themselves</em>. Therefore,
        the odds are excellent that the same could be done with the GlassFish V3 Config API. Indeed, the <span class="code">Delegate</span> interface
        could be a direct link implemented by the V3 Config API itself to eliminate the &ldquo;middleman&rdquo;.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_ExtendingAMX" id="Impacts_ExtendingAMX"></a>Extending AMX</h2>
      <p>AMX needs to be extensible such that additional modules automatically gain AMX MBeans for their configuration. These
        MBeans must be accessible through mechanisms that are generic (since they cannot be known in advance). Currently
        in AMX the <span class="code">Container</span> interface is part of any AMX MBean that is logically an enclosing
        scope around other MBeans. For example, the <span class="code">DomainConfig</span> interface logicallyl encloses
        all configuration interfaces (MBeans) for the domain, as a configuration tree.</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_PushingConfigChanges" id="Impacts_PushingConfigChanges"></a>Pushing config changes to remote servers</h2>
      <p>In GlassFish V2, there is a <span class="code"><a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_CodeCommentary.html#ConfigInterceptor">ConfigInterceptor</a></span><a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_CodeCommentary.html"> hook</a> inserted
        into the MBean call chain such that changes to configuration are recorded (on an entry/exit basis taking recursion
        into account, but not different threads). The purpose seems to be to push changes to non-DAS server instances.</p>
      <p>Some suitable equivalent will need to be found, preferably via a general purpose mechanism that does not require
        use of a customized MBeanServer. Perhaps the new configuration mechanism in V3 can provide a suitable facility at
        higher efficiency and no side effects (in contrast to today&rsquo;s implementation).</p>
      <h2><a name="Impacts_SemanticsOfConfigChanges" id="Impacts_SemanticsOfConfigChanges"></a>Semantics of configuration
        changes</h2>
      <p>Through GlassFish V2, the semantics of configuration have been largely assumed/implicit. For GlassFish V3, configuration
        APIs should be documented as being:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>synchronous or asynchronous</li>
        <li>requiring (or not) restart</li>
        <li>persisted to disk (immediately, lazily)</li>
        <li>fail-all or partial failure</li>
        <li>transactional (or not) semantics</li>
        <li>exclusive access/locking (or not) per client</li>
      </ul>

      <p>When does configuration get overwritten? How does it get backed up? </p>

      <p class="warning">New features should be added to this section as they are contemplated.<strong></strong></p>
      <h2><strong><a name="Changes_HK2" id="SupportForExternalModules2"></a>Changes forced by V3 &ldquo;HK2&rdquo; module
          and configuration changes</strong></h2>
      <p>Configuration changes drive tremendous change within the admin area. Please see <a href="GlassFishV3AdminChanges_HK2config_Analysis.html" target="_blank"><em>HK2
            Configuration (&ldquo;Injection&rdquo;)</em></a>.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="NewFeatures_SupportForExternalModules" id="NewFeatures_SupportForExternalModules"></a>Support for external modules</strong></h2>
      <p>Support for user-defined modules must be added to AMX. Configuration, monitoring and runtime MBean support should
        be available via AMX so that user modules can be first class citizens in GlassFish V3. An HK2 module should be able
        to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Obtain its configuration from an Object (that might also be an MBean). It remains to be seen wether HK2 modules
          should be required to use an MBean for configuration&mdash;perhaps a good idea.</li>
        <li>Ask AMX for the MBean(s) representing its configuration.</li>
        <li>Ask AMX to register a monitoring MBean on its behalf (subject to certain requirements/conventions).</li>
        <li>Ask AMX to register a runtime MBean on its behalf (subject to certain requirements/conventions).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="sidebar">A generic interface similar to the AMX Delegate interface should be used to decouple the AMX monitoring
        MBeans from implementation. It is particularly important to formalize this contract in the context of user supplied
      HK2 modules.<br />
          <br />
        Also, HK2 modules should be able to extend a base class that implements the module statistics, the request that an
      AMX monitoring MBean be created.</p>
      <h2><strong><a name="NewFeatures_ConfigurationRollback" id="SupportForExternalModules3"></a>Configuration rollback</strong> and/or
      backup</h2>
      <p>Loss of configuration can be a major headache in production environments. A first-class &ldquo;rollback&rdquo; feature
        should be considered for V3, along with GUI support, such that domain configuration can be rolled back to any previous
        state. This could also be useful for development efforts, especially when testing new modules. For specific thoughts
        on this, please see Byron Nevin&rsquo;s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/foo/entry/new_backup_restore_for_v3" target="_blank">blog entry</a>.</p>

      <h3>New JMXConnectors (JSR 262 Web Services Connector)</h3>
      <p><a href="https://ws-jmx-connector.dev.java.net/" target="_blank">JSR 262</a> defines a new <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/management/remote/JMXConnector.html" target="_blank">JMXConnector</a> based
        on Web Services (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/index.jsp" target="_blank">JMX</a> consists of the original API and a remote API). Here the hype and delivery time frame most likely
        outweigh any value. However, if the standard becomes final, it might be worth our effort to support this as an alternative
        connector for through-the-firewall management clients.</p>
      <p>Our time is probably better spent evolving our existing http-based connector to run with Grizzly. High performance
        is still an issue to/from the DAS and to/from server instances. The Web Services JMXConnector will apparently underperform
        even the JMX RMI-based JMXConnector.</p>
