      Weld is the reference implementation of JSR-299, and is used by JBoss AS and GlassFish to provide CDI services for
      Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications. Weld also goes beyond the environments and APIs defined by the
      JSR-299 specification by providing support for a number of other environments (such as a servlet container such as
      Tomcat, or Java SE).

      You might also want to check out the Weld Extensions project which provides portable extensions to CDI (such as log
      injection and additional annotations for creating beans), and Seam, which provides integrations with other view layers
      (such as GWT and Wicket), other frameworks (such as Drools) as well as extensions to the ecosystem (such as support
      for security).

      If you want to get started quickly using Weld (and, in turn, CDI) with JBoss AS, GlassFish or Tomcat and
      experiment with one of the examples, take a look at <xref linkend="gettingstarted"/>. Otherwise read on for a
      exhaustive discussion of using Weld in all the environments and application servers it supports and the Weld
      extensions.
