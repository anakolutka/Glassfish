NAME
     delete-system-property - removes one system property of  the
     domain,  configuration,  cluster,  or  server instance, at a
     time

SYNOPSIS
     delete-system-property
     [--help]
     [ --target  target_name ]
     [property_name]

DESCRIPTION
     Shared or clustered server  instances  will  often  need  to
     override  attributes  defined in their referenced configura-
     tion. Any configuration attribute in a server  instance  can
     be overridden through a system property of the corresponding
     name. This command deletes system properties  of  a  domain,
     configuration, cluster, or server instance.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

OPERANDS
     property_name

         The name of the system property to remove.
