DESCRIPTION
     Note -

       This command is  deprecated.  Use  the  deploy(1)  command
       instead.

     Use this command to deploy an application  directly  from  a
     development  directory.  The appropriate directory hierarchy
     and deployment descriptors conforming to the Java EE specif-
     ication must exist in the deployment directory.

     Directory deployment is for advanced developers only. Do not
     use  it  in  production environments. In production environ-
     ments, use the deploy command. Directory deployment is  only
     supported  on localhost, that is, the client and server must
     reside on the same machine. For this reason, the only values
     for the --host asadmin utility option are:

         o    localhost

         o    The value of the $HOSTNAME environment variable

         o    The IP address of the machine

     For  information  about  the  asadmin   utility,   see   the
     asadmin(1M) man page.

     The --force option makes sure the  component  is  forcefully
     (re)deployed  even  if  the  specified component has already
     been deployed or already exists. Set --force to false for  a
     first  deployment. If the application with that name is run-
     ning and force is set to false, the command fails.

     This command is supported in remote mode only.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --virtualservers
         Comma-separated list of virtual server IDs.

     --contextroot

         Valid only if the archive is a web module. It is ignored
         for  other  archive  types; defaults to filename without
         extension.

     --force
         Makes sure the component is forcefully (re)deployed even
         if  the specified component has already been deployed or
         already exists. The default is false.

     --verify

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --precompilejsp
         By default, this option is set to false, which does  not
         allow  the JSP to precompile during deployment. Instead,
         JSPs are compiled during runtime.

     --name

         Name of the deployable component.

     --uniquetablenames

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --dbvendorname
         Specifies the name of  the  database  vendor  for  which
         tables are created. Supported values include db2, mssql,
         oracle, derby, javadb, postgresql, pointbase and sybase,
         case-insensitive.  If  not  specified,  the value of the
         database-vendor-name  attribute  in  sun-ejb-jar.xml  is
         used.  If no value is specified, a connection is made to
         the resource specified by the  jndi-name  subelement  of
         the  cmp-resource  element  in the sun-ejb-jar.xml file,
         and the database vendor name is read. If the  connection
         cannot  be  established,  or  if the value is not recog-
         nized, SQL-92 compliance is presumed.

     --createtables

         Creates tables at  deployment  of  an  application  with
         unmapped  CMP  beans.  Default  is the create-tables-at-
         deploy entry in the cmp-resource  element  of  the  sun-
         ejb-jar.xml file.

     --dropandcreatetables
         Drops existing tables and creates tables during  deploy-
         ment  for  application  using unmapped CMP beans. If not
         specified, the tables are dropped  if  the  drop-tables-
         at-undeploy  entry  in  the  cmp-resource element of the
         sun-ejb-jar.xml file is set to true. The new tables  are
         created  if  the  create-tables-at-deploy  entry  in the
         cmp-resource element of the sun-ejb-jar.xml  is  set  to
         true.  When  the  component  is  redeployed,  the tables
         created by the previous deployment  are  dropped  before
         creating the new tables.

     --generatermistubs

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --availabilityenabled

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --libraries
         Specify the library JAR files by their relative or abso-
         lute   paths.   Specify   relative   paths  relative  to
         instance-root/lib/applibs. The JAR files  are  separated
         by  a colon on UNIX and Linux systems and by a semicolon
         on Windows systems. The libraries are made available  to
         the application in the order specified. Place the depen-
         dent JAR files in the domain-dir/lib directory.

     --target

         Do not specify this option. This option is retained  for
         compatibility  with  other releases. If you specify this
         option, a syntax error does not occur. Instead, the sub-
         command  runs  successfully  and  the option is silently
         ignored.

     --type
         The packaging archive type  of  the  component  that  is
         being deployed. Possible values are as follows:

         osgi

             The component is packaged as an OSGi  Alliance  bun-
             dle.

         The --type option is optional. If the component is pack-
         aged as a regular archive, omit this option.

     --properties --property
         Optional keyword-value  pairs  that  specify  additional
         properties  for the deployment. The available properties
         are determined by the implementation  of  the  component
         that is being deployed.

         Note -

           The --properties option and the --property option  are
           equivalent.  You  can  use either option regardless of
           the number of properties that you specify.

OPERANDS
     dirpath

         Path to the directory containing the exploded format  of
         the deployable archive.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1 Deploying an Application From a Directory

     The  exploded  application  to  be  deployed   is   in   the
     /home/temp/sampleApp  directory.  Since  the force option is
     set to true, if an application of that name already  exists,
     the application is redeployed.

       asadmin> deploydir --force=true --precompilejsp=true /home/temp/sampleApp
       Command deploydir executed successfully

EXIT STATUS
     0                           command executed successfully

     1                           error in executing the command
