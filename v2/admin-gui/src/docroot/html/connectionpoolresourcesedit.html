<A NAME="connectionpoolresourcesedit"></A><h4><IMG border="0" alt="Procedure" src="graphics/procedure.gif">To edit a JDBC connection pool</h4>
<p>The Edit JDBC Connection Pool page provides the means to change all
of the settings for an existing pool except its name.</p>
<ol><li><p><b>Expand the Resources, JDBC, and Connection Pools node.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Select the node for the pool you want to edit.</b></p></li>
<li><p><b>Edit the General Settings as follows:</b></p><p>The values of
the general settings depend on the specific JDBC driver that is installed.
These settings are the names of classes or interfaces in the Java programming
language.</p>

<table cellspacing="5" border="1">
<tr><th scope="col"><p>Parameter</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Description</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>Datasource Classname</p></td><td><p>The vendor-specific class name that implements the <tt>DataSource</tt> and
/ or <tt>XADataSource</tt> APIs. This class is in the JDBC driver.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Resource Type</p></td><td><p>Choices include <tt>javax.sql.DataSource</tt> (local transactions
only), <tt>javax.sql.XADataSource</tt> (global transactions), and <tt>java.sql.ConnectionPoolDataSource</tt> (local transactions, possible
performance improvements).</p></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p><b>Edit the Pool Settings as follows:</b></p><p>A set of physical
database connections reside in the pool. When an application requests a connection,
the connection is removed from the pool, and when the application releases
the connection, it is returned to the pool.</p>

<table cellspacing="5" border="1">
<tr><th scope="col"><p>Parameter</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Description</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>Initial and Minimum Pool Size</p></td><td><p>The minimum number of connections in the pool. This value also determines
the number of connections placed in the pool when the pool is first created
or when application server starts.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Maximum Pool Size</p></td><td><p>The maximum number of connections in the pool.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Pool Resize Quantity</p></td><td><p>When the pool shrinks toward the minimum pool size it is resized in
batches. This value determines the number of connections in the batch. Making
this value too large delays connection recycling; making it too small will
be less efficient.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Idle Timeout</p></td><td><p>The maximum time in seconds that a connection can remain idle in the
pool. After this time expires, the connection is removed from the pool.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Max Wait Time</p></td><td><p>The amount of time the application requesting a connection will wait
before getting a connection timeout. Because the default wait time is long,
the application might appear to hang indefinitely.</p></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p><b>Edit the Connection Validation as follows:</b></p><p>Optionally,
the application server can validate connections before they are passed to
applications. This validation allows the application server to automatically
reestablish database connections if the database becomes unavailable due to
network failure or database server crash. Validation of connections incurs
additional overhead and slightly reduces performance.</p>

<table cellspacing="5" border="1">
<tr><th scope="col"><p>Parameter</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Description</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>Connection Validation</p></td><td><p>Select the Required checkbox to enable connection validation.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Validation Method</p></td><td><p>The application server can validate database connections in three ways:
auto-commit, metadata, and table.</p><p>auto-commit and metadata - The application server validates a connection
by calling the <tt>con.getAutoCommit()</tt> and <tt>con.getMetaData()</tt> methods. However, because many JDBC drivers cache the results of
these calls, they do not always provide reliable validations. Check with the
driver vendor to determine whether these calls are cached or not.</p><p>table - The application queries a database table that are specified.
The table must exist and be accessible, but it doesn't require any rows. Do
not use an existing table that has a large number of rows or a table that
is already frequently accessed.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Table Name</p></td><td><p>If you selected table from the Validation Method combo box, then specify
the name of the database table here.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>On Any Failure</p></td><td><p>If you select the checkbox labelled Close All Connections, if a single
connection fails, then the application server closes all connections in the
pool and then reestablish them. If you do not select the checkbox, then individual
connections are reestablished only when they are used.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Allow Non Component Callers</p></td><td><p>Enable the pool to be used by non-component callers such as Servlet
Filters and Lifecycle modules.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Non Transactional Connections</p></td><td><p>Enable to return all non-transactional connections.</p></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p><b>Edit the Transaction Isolation as follows:</b></p><p>Because
a database is usually accessed by many users concurrently, one transaction
might update data while another attempts to read the same data. The isolation
level of a transaction defines the degree to which the data being updated
is visible to other transactions. For details on isolation levels, refer to
the documentation of the database vendor.</p>

<table cellspacing="5" border="1">
<tr><th scope="col"><p>Parameter</p></th><th scope="col"><p>Description</p></th></tr>
<tr><td><p>Transaction Isolation</p></td><td><p>Makes it possible to select the transaction isolation level for the
connections of this pool. If left unspecified, the connections operate with
default isolation levels provided by the JDBC driver.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Isolation Level</p></td><td><p>Only applicable if the isolation level has been specified. If you select
the Guaranteed checkbox, then all connections taken from the pool have the
same isolation level. For example, if the isolation level for the connection
is changed programmatically (with <tt>con.setTransactionIsolation</tt>)
when last used, this mechanism changes the status back to the specified isolation
level.</p></td></tr>
</table></li>
<li><p><b>Edit the Properties.</b></p><p>In the Additional Properties
table, it is possible to specify properties, such as the database name (URL),
user name, and password. Because the properties vary with database vendor,
consult the vendor's documentation for details.</p>
