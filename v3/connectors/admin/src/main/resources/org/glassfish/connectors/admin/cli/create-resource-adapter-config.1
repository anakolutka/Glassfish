NAME
     create-resource-adapter-config - creates  the  configuration
     information in domain.xml for the connector module

SYNOPSIS
     create-resource-adapter-config
     [--help]
      [ --threadpoolid  threadpool] [--property (property name=value)[:name=value]*]
      raname

DESCRIPTION
     The create-resource-adapter-config  command  creates  confi-
     guration  information for the connector module. This command
     can be executed prior to deploying a  resource  adapter,  so
     that  the configuration information is available at the time
     of deployment. The  resource  adapter  config  can  also  be
     created  after  the  resource  adapter  is deployed. In this
     case, the resource adapter is restarted with the new  confi-
     guration.  You  must  first  create  a threadpool, using the
     create-threadpool command, and then identify that threadpool
     value as the ID in the --threadpoolid option.

OPTIONS
     --help

         Displays the help text for the subcommand.

     --target
         This option has been deprecated.

     --threadpoolid

         The threadpool ID from which the work manager  gets  the
         thread. This option takes only one threadpool ID.

     --property
         This option specifies the  configuration  properties  of
         the  resource  adapter  java bean. The properties can be
         specified as name value pairs separated by a colon (:).

OPERANDS
     raname

         This operand indicates the connector module name. It  is
         the value of the resource-adapter-name in the domain.xml
         file.
